Tinder,2022-05-28 15:04:00,Tinder Gold Is No Longer Worth Your Money,2,"I used to unironically like Tinder, even at its base form I’ve gotten matches that ended up leading to great relationships. Unfortunately, as time has passed the company has made taken away features and slowly asked for more money to unlock them; specifically with super likes. 
     I’ve travelled alot and used tinder gold each time I travelled to find friends in new countries. Having five super likes a day helped me stand out from the crowd and led to fairly consistent matches. Even on a base account having access to the occasional super like was a huge help. 
     Nowadays on a base tinder account you don’t have any super likes which is genuinely a huge detriment, and on tinder gold you get five a week. A massive decrease of 35 a week to 5. But the price remained the same???
     A super like was a fantastic way to differentiate yourself in an environment where first impressions are everything. And for some guys and gals who are great people but not super models it can help hedge your bets to match with people you have a genuine interest with. I think taking that tool to consistently show interest in people you genuinely like was a bad decision for the company.
     I use to be a fairly consistent subscriber for Tinder Gold and I used to speak highly of it too, but with these new changes I will never again give this company my money.",WordiestTomb
Tinder,2022-03-04 19:37:56,They Can Shut You Down With No Explanation,1,"Within 48 hrs of having downloaded the app (most of that time I was traveling so I wasn’t even very active) they put my account under review and asked for some verification photos which I provided. Then I waited a couple days to let things get sorted out before writing the customer service people, I received a response saying that they were escalating the issue for further review, ok no problem do your thing, then I received a follow up email saying my account was all good and I should be able to log in. But then when I went to open the app it said I had been banned. This is insane because I’m a super nice respectfully person, only had pleasant and positive interactions with the few people I was chatting with, never said anything that could be deemed offensive or violate their community guidelines or terms of service at all, all of the photos of me were fairly recent… I was shocked. After reaching out again they refused to offer any explanation and said the results were final and permanent. I feel like I was treated very unfairly, and should have at least been given a reason for what was the issue other than “we take our terms and conditions and/or community guidelines very seriously.” Of course, and so would I. Im just highly disappointed and feel betrayed by this app. Out of all the ratchet stuff going on constantly, I get banned and I was nothing other than kind and respectful to everyone I chatted with.",Mr. McGuillacutty
Tinder,2022-09-01 04:33:02,"Deserves shutting down, it’s a scam.",1,"What can I say? What should I say? It doesn’t help you meet people or get you dates, but it does do what it was designed to do, make the creators/developers money. Limiting the number of swipes for one, designed to make money, pay for extra swaps you sad lonely peasant. See who likes you? Cough up the dough. 6 weeks so far, zero matches. I’ve swiped, and swiped, and swiped. Unfortunately, Tinder is not for dating, it’s for hookups, only the most attractive people get to use it for screwing. If you want a meaningful relationship, look elsewhere, otherwise you’re wasting your time. In fact, just find some courage and bravery, and the strength to face rejection in the real world, because you’re only going to meet real people and find a real relationship by going outside and meeting real people, not swiping on shallow and “pretty” people day in and day out on a cash grab app preying on the lonely or desperate. Do not, I repeat, do not get this app for a relationship. If you’re an 11/10, or even a 10/10, and feel like a casual hookup, by all means go for it, but don’t think your soulmate is on here, or that you’ll find “the one,” ‘cause that ain’t happening and it ain’t realistic. Please, go outside, go where people are. Roll the dice. Maybe someone you find attractive has a partner already. Maybe they don’t, that’s just a risk you have to take, and it’s already way way more effective than even 100 days on this app will ever be.",Dako_the_Austinite
Tinder,2022-01-16 03:06:49,Tinder went downhill,1,"I don’t normally leave reviews but it’s really surprising to me how downhill Tinder has gone. Idk if there are just too many users now and people get put way down in the deck unless they buy the overpriced platinum membership or what, but it’s a night and day difference. Anecdotally, I used to get a dozen or more likes a day and at least 3 matches, and if I boosted I would get several dozens of likes by the end of the 30 minutes. Now I’ll be lucky to get a LIKE, let alone a match. I very rarely get matched with someone I liked first, which is completely different than it was a couple years ago. Idk if it’s because I came back to the app after a few years of inactivity (I was in a relationship), and Tinder sank the rating of my profile so low that I never get surfaced to other people. I’m not going to spend upwards of 50 bucks a month or whatever it is on a platinum membership to get the same experience I did a year and a half ago. App ratings have sunken since, prices of memberships have increased, and it just seems like the app is starting to die and they’ll die by squeezing out as much money out of you as they can. Fwiw even after I got a gold membership and used a boost, I still log in every day and see no likes. So I don’t even think paying money is an option for you to get in Tinder’s good graces unless you get the platinum membership. Just not worth it. Anyway, Hinge seems like a better option.",Hardshot4488
Tinder,2023-03-03 08:20:44,Women/Fems get permanently banned :),1,"I've been on this app off and on since 2018 and never had any problems, even impulsively paid for premium a few times. The other day I loaded up the app to answer a message and instead was met with a cute little message from Tinder saying I've been banned and can no longer use Tinder, ever! I was super confused because I know I hadn't done anything that would've caused me to get booted so dramatically. So I very nicely emailed customer support asking what I did wrong and if there's any way I could appeal. I waited patiently for a response, which ended up being an automated message just reiterating the fact that I had been banned from using Tinder. So turns out you cannot appeal, or even contact anyone after your banishment. After that I did some googling and seen that A LOT of confused women who've been banned from Tinder came together and found out that the answer to why they've all been banned is butthurt men! When they don't get their ideal response from women they falsely report their accounts in a fit of rage and Tinder immediately bans them! I also found out that the majority of my women/fem friends have also been banned in the past without reason. It's really funny to me because it looks like these straight men are about to get bit in their little quivering bums when this app becomes a meatfest and they've got no one else to swipe on. So good luck with keeping the business up Tinder! :)",i dont want peta
Tinder,2022-11-11 11:49:17,Horrible support.,1,"My account was hacked and the hacker must’ve edited my profile or I’m not sure what happened but when I tried to log back in it said my account was banned for violating community guidelines. So I emailed support, I explained the situation and even offered any proof I could gather to show I was not to blame. Instead of offering any help, or even looking into anything, I was sent back an email telling me there’s no point, and I’ll never be able to use tinder again using my Facebook or phone number (you can no longer sign up using just email). I can understand they are trying to keep their platform safe, but considering this could easily be proved if they just looked into the matter, but are in all honesty seemingly too lazy to do so. I was a premium member, it also doesn’t stop your membership. So despite my account being banned for an unknown amount of time, I have still been charged for the membership. They gave me no other notice that my account was banned or even under investigation other than when I tried to sign in again, so I have no way of knowing. When I brought that up to support they said it was my fault because “it’s stated on the bottom of the screen when you try to log back in” but again, I hadn’t tried signing in for a couple months, so with no other notice, I had no way of knowing I had to cancel the subscription. Overall this situation was ridiculous and unessicary.",357_t0
Tinder,2022-03-10 07:51:53,Don’t waste your time or money!,1,"So, I have had Tinder off and on for the past few years. But recently after deleting my account to start fresh and take a break. About 2 weeks ago I redownloaded the app to give it another shot. However, I was randomly banned without any explanation as to why. I believe I was banned because so many guys I had matched with made sexual advances towards me and I denied them. So they most likely reported my account. And although I have only been back on the app for 2 weeks, despite my profile saying I’m looking for a relationship so many guys asked for sexual favors or wanted to hookup. Making vulgar and crass remarks unprompted often right off the bat. Which I should not be reported for. Then I emailed tinder to request my account be unbanned and I was given some dry, robot response. With no consideration of what I had experienced using the app. So ladies be aware that this can happen to you too. Even if it is not at all your fault! It would be nice to know what terms and community guidelines I supposedly “violated”. Not to mention, I reported the sexual commentary I received constantly. There is a huge issue with men who are looking to cheat on their significant others on this app. I’m sure I am not alone in this. But how am I more at fault then people who are committing adultery? I not anyone else should not be punished for declining their advances and wanting to actually DATE someone we connect with! Crazy concept.",#BrutuallyHonest
Tinder,2022-09-28 07:27:00,"Worst app, with the worst support team.",1,"I have been a long time Tinder user. I am currently permanently banned from the service, and I am 100% unsure as to why. I was always polite to people on the service, and I never broke the community guidelines. I was always keeping my profile pictures updated as well as my bios. I even went as far as to verify myself for tender, 2x. I randomly sign in when I to find that I am banned. The worst part is the girl that I have been talking to for the last week now has no contact information or way to get a hold of me. On top of that I have now been robbed the $40 due to being a tender platinum member because that’s how you get matches on the app. It’s 100% paid to play on tinder, and anyone who tells you otherwise, is a liar. The most painful part about this, is I want to meet a girl abroad, and now I am completely cut out of that. Thanks to tinder for taking all my money for the last year and a half, and never finding me matches that will respond. Even when I’m paying for the App. Ps trying to appeal with support is pointless. They will take their time responding, and that’s if they respond at all. The first time I messaged, I had someone tell me that my account was banned. Didn’t give me a reason and then immediately close the case so I could no longer message them. Pay for this app at your own risk nine times out of 10, they aren't going to work for you, but in their own interest.",Cungpowchickin
Tinder,2021-06-26 09:20:43,BANNED FOR NO REASON,1,"I've used the app almost since the app first was created, and it has led to some decent dates and friendships along the way. I truly enjoyed the app (not so much the ""match- and-silence/ignore"" trend, but that falls on the user, not the app). I've posted rather silly pictures of my self fully clothed. I've never harassed anyone or pursued anyone beyond a clear ignoring of a message or unmatch. Not was my profile spam or fake in any way. I was instructed by the generic automated email when I reached out and all I was told is that I ""violated the user agreement or terms of use"" or something along those lines. When I checked those terms, there was not one thing that could be remotely close to any term that I've broken that l've done in the years of using the app. And when I replied back with elaboration, there was, of course, no response. They also stopped allowing appeals, so now l'm unable to get back on the app. There are other apps, I know. But this just doesn't sit right with me - someone who uses the app onlv for it's intended purpose and is not life banned for the app for no apparent reason, given no explanation, and no opportunity to fix it. 

This app was in the end a waste of my time and money (oh yeah, I subscribed multiple times to their advanced features to see who swiped on me because why not?) 

Beware any newcomer to this app that this is a fairly common issue on getting banned for no reason! Enjoy it whilst you can...",gậhch
Tinder,2022-04-09 03:04:07,"Too many fakes, scammers, “catfish”",1,"Nothing is done to ensure that the people on the site are actually genuinely looking for a match. Captchas aren’t installed, having a “verified” profile is optional, most members don’t fill anything in the bio because it’s not even required. Often you’ll see people that are thousands of miles away by mileage, or people that are nearby, but their “live in” city is thousands of miles away because they’re just visiting your area. Needs to be a setting to only show those people that are physically nearby and also live nearby, or where you can select it if you want to see visitors. There’s no way to tell political leanings unless they put certain tags in their profile or put it in their bio. There’s no way to know important things like if they have pets or drink/smoke unless they happened to answer those questions-they’re optional. There’s no way to make it so you only see people that don’t have pets or don’t smoke or restrict out certain tags a person might add as their interest, for example “Activist”. To be a better app, these things need the focus, not the cutesy “Vibes” questions that don’t have much meaning to whether they’re going to be a good partner or not. And having to “Boost” in order to be seen by people you like is lame - it ought to just automatically put them front and center for them and tell you if they rejected you or not. But anything for a buck, eh, Tinder?",Navyjax2
Tinder,2022-02-22 20:00:53,Only giving it 2 stars because I met a nice friend.,2,"I’ll keep it short and simple. Here you have an app that’s made to connect people and bring them together. In order for you to see who liked you, you need to pay. In order to get more attention via a boost, you need to pay. You want better “top picks”, you need to pay. If your like me, and already literally hated the idea of using dating apps, then don’t waste your time here unless you have money laying around that you don’t mind throwing at this app all the time.
Not only Tinder, but most “dating” apps are just broken. I get the idea of bringing people together along with preferences to narrow it down, however Tinder and others try to fit all groups into one. What I mean by that is - this is a dating app right? Where you go to meet people to, ya know, date? I’d say these apps are broken down into three categories of use - relationships, hooking up, and validation. I’d say most people here are on for validation. They don’t want love, they want the love they get from 20 people swiping on them inflating their ego. The next small group is looking for just sex, and the next is actual dating. There really should be an app out there for people to sign up for just for all that attention people need and want. Dating apps? Ya ok, more like feed someone else’s already inflated ego app.",IBLopez33
Tinder,2022-03-16 05:15:55,Notifications are belittling,1,"Had a notification today that stated essentially “the only way to get out there in the dating world is to get back online - who would’ve known 😱” not only is it unprofessional to assume that I’m currently wanting to get on tinder to use for dating currently, but it’s also ridiculous to think that Tinder is the only way to meet a significant other. Not only the snarky and condescending wording by whoever decided to write this notification, but to not respect my boundaries of when I chose if I’d like to use tinder for my dating choices or not is crazy to me and others. If I don’t want to use Tinder for the meantime, I don’t need your team to try to convey a disrespectful message/notification to me. Sarcasm towards your clients is the absolute dumbest way to get them to use your app and spend money as well. Not only that, you want people to pay 24 dollars a month for a premium package for a site that has a history of hookups, not long term relationship success. You really try to screw your clients in more than one way. Deleting this app for good tonight, and if you have any respect for yourself, I suggest others do the same as well. Obviously this company cares more about how much money they can get out of you, not how meaningful the relationships and success rate of long term relationships that are built from them. If I could rate this company and app worse than a 1 star, I would.",BigMike3621
Tinder,2022-07-29 17:50:44,Highly toxic and depressing,1,"Wow Tinder has gotten to low as to pay for 5 star reviews. I’m seeing fake reviews with 5 stars saying “good”. So glad I stopped using this retched app. Needs to be banned from the apple store. 

Too many people using this out of boredom and too many douche bags. Please don’t waste your time on this app. No one uses this seriously. It’s just a matching game for most. Also, if you’re a person of color especially a black person just know it takes just a few swipes from someone racist for you to be lowered in your desirability meaning. If you live in an area where people are swiping left for your skin color your profile is less likely to show up for someone on the same level of attractiveness as you. This isn’t just tinder but all dating apps across the board. I’m an above average attractive black woman and in person I have no problem attracting guys pre covid but on here I rarely get any guys I would ever find attractive. Their algorithm controls who you get to see and how attractive you are, theirs so many things wrong with that system and I’m honestly disgusted by all these dating apps. They don’t care if you find love they just care about keeping you on as long as possible. Oh and the CEO once bragged that they had an above average desirability according to their algorithms. Everyone should do research on how dating algorithms work, stop wasting your money.",Gale22
Tinder,2021-06-22 19:23:43,Oh boy,2,"Just recently got out of a relationship and decided to dive back into the dating app world, and all I have to say is wow. Tinder has really slipped. What used to be a brilliantly simple and effective dating app has turned into a frustrating, convoluted, pay-walled mess. For Tinder to be even remotely useful, you have to pay for it. And once you do, you’re allowed features that are literally free on other apps. Wanna see who likes you? You’re going to have to pay more a month than you do on a Netflix subscription for that. Btw, Hinge does that for free. Wanna leave a comment on someone’s picture? Surely you can do that with the Gold membership, right? Nope. Gotta shell out even more money for ~platinum~. Guess who also does it for free? You got it. Hinge (and I think OKC too). And even after emptying your wallet on one of their higher subscription tiers, you still only get one boost a week, and you’re still hounded with pop ups every 10 minutes to try out their creepiest feature - the super like. All of this on top of the inherent dating app negatives (ghosting, catfishing, creeps, excessive filters, etc) and you’re in for a miserable ride. Save yourself the stress and money and try literally any app other than Tinder. Or just go to a bar. You’ll spend about the same amount of money but at the very least you’ll get a good buzz.",FazzieATX
Tinder,2022-08-04 18:53:24,One sided…,1,"So obviously the app itself is fine. Easy to use. The one thing that bothers me is the “interests or passions”. They are all these left wing liberal passions but none for anyone else. For example: pro-choice, LGBTQ rights, feminism, vaccination stickers on profiles etc… so my question is where is the passion for pro-life? Or religion/God? The Bible? There are plenty of passions on the right that are just completely ignored. The more time I spend on this app the more I realize how it’s just another app from liberal California that’s “woke” 

I put that I am unvaccinated, pro-life, love Jesus and looking for that in a partner on my profile on day 1 and I got an email from Tinder saying “they don’t approve of hateful messages to other users and if I do it again I will be banned” but I hadn’t even sent a message yet?? I’ve seen profiles say hail Satan, F trump, F republicans, let’s riot and burn buildings down on first date, looking for 3 ways, if you’re not vaccinated go kill yourself etc… but none of these profiles get taken down.

My message to other Jesus loving single people - either don’t download Tinder or just be straight up with your beliefs in your bio. Because 95 percent of tinder users have 0 values whatsoever and it’s a good way to weed them all out. Don’t change who you are or your beliefs for anyone. Don’t let pressure from media, social media, dating apps, friends make you give in to the evil.",Rager2112
Tinder,2021-03-21 18:20:52,why take requests if you don’t make appeals,1,"After not using my account for a couple days I opened the app to check my messages, only to find out that my account had been banned. I read all the terms and guidelines to see what i could possible have violated, and came up with nothing. I submitted a request to appeal the ban, only to get an automated email saying that  they aren’t taking appeals “at this time” and that my account was banned for breaking community guidelines (and didn’t even specify which I had violated). Has tinder ever taken appeals? Because from what I have read it appears not. Why even make it an option to submit a request if nothing will change? It seems like a massive waste of time on both ends. I am apparently not the only person that this has happened to either. Tinder needs to fix their customer service to accept appeals and to talk to a real person about issues with one’s account. The handling of the situation on Tinder’s part was terrible. I had a lot of fun using the app when I did go on it and am extremely frustrated that I was banned without any reason or warning. How is it even possible to violate community guidelines when you’re not actively using the app and don’t have a fallacious or promotional profile? In addition, I am still getting message notifications from the app, even though my account is banned and it signed me out. Absolutely mind-boggling to me.",samirivpos
Tinder,2021-08-24 09:30:18,Banned for no reason,1,"Oooo I’m livid I’ve used tinder forever. I deleted my old account for awhile as I had ended up in a relationship but after that not working out I reinstalled tinder and made myself a new account. I did not violate any terms. I didn’t even have a bio and just selfies as pictures, nor did I message any inappropriate things. Honestly I barely messaged anyone I just sent people my Snapchat so the reasoning behind the ban is what I’m confused about. Especially considering I’d had my new account open for like a month before it was banned and hadn’t changed anything on my profile, and also when I went to open the app and found out I was banned I hadn’t been on it in like a week. I was so mad considering once you’re banned that’s it. You cannot use tinder again unless you get a new phone number and Apple ID. I tried getting in contact with some type of support but couldn’t find much help. I emailed about an appeal for my ban but all I got back was a robotic email stating I was banned and can’t be unbanned but still have no reasoning. It’s really pathetic honestly. Then I come on here and realize a bunch of people are getting banned for no reason left and right. Y’all need to get it together and fix this. This is going to drop yalls ratings and user amount tremendously especially considering y’all are getting rid of users yourself by banning them.",mindyrenee7
Tinder,2021-05-22 07:43:09,men: just say no. not even once.,1,"I know it’s tempting and you want to use tinder, but wait a minute man it’s not worth it. Even for pretty attractive guys, it will extremely difficult to find matches and it will destroy your self esteem. Tinder algorithms make this problem even worse. Even if you think you don’t care, you’ll end up feeling terrible about yourself even if you’re a good guy. Academic research on the apps show that top ~20% most attractive guys get almost all of the like and matches, like the vast vast majority, and that women users rank ~80% of men as below average. So essentially if you are 80th percentile or above, top 20+% of all men your age in attractiveness, hot and built, you will do okay. For the other 80% of us average and above average guys, just don’t join, don’t let it ruin your self esteem, don’t be a simp.

and that’s assuming you don’t get scammed. Lots and lots of women on these apps pretending they want to date or meet up with you and then they convince you to send them “half the money for the hotel” over Venmo or “Uber money to come over” or whatever and then they block you and you never hear from them again. Come on guys, don’t be simps. Don’t send women money, ESPECIALLY if you’ve never met her in person. If she wants money and you haven’t met her in person yet, it a scam always always always.

Tinder,2022-08-24 04:58:11,Trans Problem,1,"I’m a 22 year old man and I used to enjoy using this app until they went woke. They have 3 options for what you want to find/interested in- Women, Men, and Everyone. I have it set to Man seeking Women and yet I still keep coming across “Women” who are actually men. They need to include a 4th option for Other. I do not consider men who want to be women, women. They are still men and should either be in the mens category or in Other. I don’t want to see or be liked by MEN taking pictures dressed at a woman or even worse a MAN taking pictures in a bikini when their junk is still attached and showing. It is definitely not suitable for minors to be seeing it and let’s all be honest, it’s mostly minors who use the app. Please fix this issue tinder or else you’ll see a huge decline of users on your platform who don’t believe in that woke garbage. If they are born a man they should either select man or other and shouldn’t be shown to those of us who are normal people(heterosexual).

Tinder,2022-01-17 18:08:29,Fun while it lasted,1,"Well it was fun while it lasted but it looks like tinder is finally pay to win now. Started out small with taking away the amount of likes you had every 12 hours. Than they took away the super like feature, unless you pay for it, and then they started to shadow banned accounts that were not signed up for tinder gold. For the last few months the work around to all this was to make a new account every couple of weeks. New accounts get shown as normal but then after 2-3 weeks you were shadow banned. No big deal just delete your account and make a new one but it looks like the money hungry leeches at tinder caught on. You can’t delete your account anymore and instead of being shown for 2-3 weeks you are now only shown for 24 hours. You are still able to swipe on people however it doesn’t matter. No matter if you swipe right or left on someone you will still be shown their account each time you log back on. I came across the same accounts 9 times in a row. You now have unlimited likes but again this is worthless as your likes don’t mean anything because the people you like won’t see it. I really liked tinder. Was my go to dating app and I had nothing but positives to say about it for the past few years. But now I guess it is officially dead unless your fork over some cash.",Td8699
Tinder,2022-05-18 04:58:03,Fantastic app but...,4,"Some bugs need improvement. Sometimes I open the app with a message from more than one person so I'll click on one conversation and the app switches the photos of the two people I received messages from.  

Next I was checking out someones profile when I swipe surge started. I was thinking about swiping right for this person but the swipe surge seems to have removed their profile and I never got to give them the swipe right. As someone who has just moved to a new area and is trying to meet people, this is extremely disappointing to see a glitch like that happen.

A new issue that I’ve encountered frequently recently. I’ll receive a message from a match and can only access the conversation through the notification that pops up when I don’t have tinder open. If I open tinder from the home screen icon, it looks like the match is gone. But when I open from the notification that’s still in my phone’s system, I can still send and receive messages from that match. It’s starting to make me wonder how many matches I’ve actually lost and how many were just lost to a glitch in the system. Please fix this.",JTD457
Tinder,2021-12-31 04:51:49,My “Tinderella” Story,5,"I downloaded Tinder because a few friends told me to. I was nervous because I figured it wasn’t something for me. I’ve always been the relationship type of person so I figured an app known for other things was definitely not where I’d find love. Unlike some of these bad reviews I didn’t buy Tinder gold or anything like that, I actually thought the regular app was quite fun. I honestly got addicted to it and would spend a lot of time swiping. I swiped right on this adorable, tall, guitar playing guy and we immediately matched (yay). He texted me first and we hit it off straight away. Turns out him and I went to the same college and everything. We had SOOO much in common. After getting my phone number and facetiming for a couple days, he picked me up and we went on our first date, which would be one of many many wonderful dates. Little did I know downloading Tinder would lead to meeting the love of my life. Just thought I should share my “Tinderella” story on here to let everybody know that while Tinder is super fun, it can also lead to something more than just somebody to text or talk to. :)",Pedrotheoboe
Tinder,2021-11-14 04:00:37,Cooperate strikes again,5,"I’ve seen the ratings go down for years, and here’s why: Tinder reasonably realized they made more money from people who bought tinder premium or gold in 2015. In the earlier days, tinder gold bought you the most basic upgrades, like unlimited swipes. Nothing special. Today however, they’ve gotten so greedy that they made two separate algorithms: if you’ve payed for tinder gold, you’re placed in an algorithm that will match you frequently with people who swiped right on your profile. If you didn’t pay, then you are enrolled in an algorithm that purposely avoids people who’ve swiped right on your profile. Furthermore, I’ve both the free version of tinder, and I’ve used tinder gold, and I’ve found that disgustingly, you find more minorities and people people with a larger body size tend to appear significantly more frequently on the free tinder algorithm. This overt prejudice blatantly contrasts with how accepting of diversity they seem on their advertisements. Don’t be fooled, Match Group clearly doesn’t care about you and your love life, rather on the size of of your pocket and the color/ shape you possess.",HeuUs
Tinder,2022-05-11 12:50:11,Fix this please,2,"I love the app. I really do. I used to be scared of people, too scared to even see food delivery drivers. I can't handle going to bars to meet people and I don't go out much. I used tinder to make friends and partners, and be able to meet them. I used the app for multiple years and even spent a lot of money on it. But the reason my rating is low is because the feeling i have right now. Recently, i'd been getting pop ups that made me redo the same test over and over to prove i'm human. And then when I went to get on today and respond to someone I was going to meet, it said I was banned. I get there are a lot of bot accounts and whatnot. But I've been loyally using tinder for years and wanted to keep doing so. There should be an appeal of some sort. Adapting a ""you're banned no matter what"" stance is unfair to your consumers. If it has happened to me, I can only imagine who else has dealt with. I, nor anyone else, went through the loops and holes to pay or get verified just to be banned out of nowhere. Imagine you actually get a strong connection with someone and are about to meet them. Then BAM, you're banned and will probably never speak to that person again. 

All the other features I love, and really hope Tinder fixes this issue so that I can have my account back.",SpaceyMutt
Tinder,2022-06-19 16:07:25,Disappearing matches and app lies,2,"Ive noticed that sometimes when i get a match the entire profile ive matched with just goes away out of nowhere. At first, i thought it was because they chose to unmatch since thats happened before but then a few days later they will reappear but the conversations ive had with them will be gone. I once got 7 matches in one day and had fairly good talks with all of them but then they all disappear. Then a few days later they're all back with no notifications or anything they're just back so now it looks like im ignoring them. The app also lies to you about how many people are in your area to keep you on longer because if it really helped people to delete the app and actually find someone they'd lose money. I know this because after swipping for a few minutes the app will tell me to increase my range because no one is left. But coincidentally all of my top 10 picks for weeks will all be within 10 miles of me. And when i increase my distance range there will still be people in my area even though the app just told me no one is left. Terrible app that lies to you to make money and buggy matches. If you end up actually having a good talk with someone just get their snap and delete this app",shfiek
Tinder,2023-03-12 17:20:13,Banned for no reason,1,"Like other reviewers, I was banned for no reason. Lately the app was glitchy for me. My profile disappeared from matches and then reappeared. It was odd. So, I had to delete and then redownload the app twice in the last day. Maybe that triggered the ban…? They never explain why & just send you their terms & community guidelines which I doubt they have read because I did nothing that violated it.  There was nothing in my profile or correspondences that was against their terms. Everything I wrote was a  G rating. I wonder if the men who send 🍆pics are still on there. I guess it’s time to find another route to meet people. Sad because I had some interesting matches which are now dead in their tracks. Incredibly disappointing since the ban seems so random and unwarranted. And, they prompted me to report a match which was ridiculous. The guy, who was visiting NYC from London, wrote that he met up with friends & visited some galleries. Nothing in our conversation was controversial. I know there are so many people on Tinder, but beware. They behave like a bouncer at a hot club & this could happen to you.

Oh, and there’s no warning whatsoever. And in this climate with so many angry men, it’s just ridiculous that they don’t do any research into why people are reported. I get way more customer support from Poshmark if there’s a dispute.",Bianca144
Tinder,2021-11-03 03:15:43,Why did I get banned?,1,"Now typically I wouldn’t get upset over something so silly but the fact that I’ve never been banned from anything and that I actually didn’t do anything wrong really bothers me. I read through all your terms and conditions and thought maybe I made an honest mistake and somehow violated them but no. I did not violate your terms and conditions and I have no idea why you banned me. I’m gonna take it as a sign that I just shouldn’t be on Tinder but I mean still. Plus this app has no way to like fight the ban or even be reconsidered unless you are simply under review which is kinda dumb. I’m a real 21 yr old female, who is from American and currently lives in Italy for my job and I was literally on Tinder for a day but my phone service was not operating correctly so I tried deleting my account but it wouldn’t let me so I paused it. Then when my phone started to operate correctly again I tried to log back in to unpause my account and it said I was banned. None of my photos are copyright and there’s no way I could’ve gotten reported or anything when my phone was so messed up I couldn’t get any matches like it just kept putting the same people up over and over. Maybe you should ban the app instead of me. Whether it be my phone service or just your app bugging out, who knows but it definitely is not my fault.",AlexRuck99
Tinder,2021-07-02 03:13:35,Tinder Ban,1,"I’ve been using tinder for years. I’ve never had any issues with it. Two days ago my account randomly disappeared from the app. My account disappeared and neither my Facebook (which was connected to it), phone number, or email were recognized by tinder. I contact costumer support and they give me a few options. That’s when I remember I’m also connected to the app through my laptop. I check and my account still exists. Somehow that brings back my account on the mobile app. Problem solved right? Last night I match with a person, reach out to them. They reply with a rude response so I report them and they’re unmatched. Today I go on to the app to discover I’ve somehow been banned. No reason given. The only connection I could think was the random glitch two days before or me reporting someone for rude behavior. Strangely enough my account still exists on my computer so I’m assuming this is another glitch. I have Tinder Platinum for another week so this makes the problem more annoying. Based on the recent reviews other people our getting banned. I hope this gets resolved or the app makes a statement. My advice if you’re planning on using Tinder avoid paying for a description on the chance you’re banned out of nowhere. At least until the app recognizes there are issues and attempts to fix them.",Promicin92
Tinder,2022-12-12 04:31:23,Banned by bots,1,"Do not get Tinder. I had the app for a long time when it came out, never had an issue. I recently got the app and decided let’s go premium. Two days later I was shadow banned and then emailed saying “my bad, you are visible”. Because of this I downloaded Hinge. On Tinder I have only matched with bots that want Snapchats so they can try to sell their content, one in every 10 being a real person. Then all of a sudden I log in one day to see that I was Banned. I reached out to the company via email only to get the answer that they have no information on why I was banned and are unable to look into it.  A week later I was banned for the reason that Match owns Tinder and Hinge along with other apps. Hinge told me that Tinder would be able to provide me with information on why I was banned, when I reached out to them again I was replied with this. “Unfortunately even with no proof that you have violated the terms and policies we have in place, we cannot undo the process we have taken. We have no way to appeal banned accounts. Based off of information we have on your account, it was reported multiple times by users who no longer use the app. Thanks.”  So they basically confessed that I was banned by bots and have no way to look into it. Don’t get the app, at least Hinge has a nice customer service email.",baron527
Tinder,2022-07-03 16:58:45,Shady practices and easily exploited moderation,1,"My complaints with tinder primarily fall into two categories: auto-moderation and the gender ratio. 

Moderation is automated, with profiles being banned automatically after receiving *any* three reports, regardless of their validity or content. This is a common way to cut costs that is known to be easily exploitable by users. Men and women maliciously false report each other for rejection or not replying fast enough, leading to automated bans that cannot be contested. You can find videos of so-called “pickup artists” getting women banned after exchanging phone numbers so there will be less competition for her attention. I personally was banned after not replying to women for two weeks; several of them falsely reported me out of revenge and tinder support refuses to review the situation.  

Tinder’s male-to-female ratio is notoriously poor, in some regions being as bad as 9-to-1 according to one study. This leads to unhappiness for everyone, as women are spammed and men are ignored. To give the impression of there being more women, tinder ignores your search preferences and shows you women far outside of your age and geographic ranges. I do not want to date 18 year olds, they cannot hold a conversation. If you want to see women no less than X years old, you must set your minimum age to X+3 in my experience. This is clearly not a bug.",Robert MacTenj
Tinder,2022-11-25 05:56:03,FIX YOUR APP AND SITE,1,"I normally love Tinder and with their newest updates they include the ability to share a lot more information about yourself than you could before (if you smoke, are 420 friendly, are in college, etc) and you can even specify what you are looking for as far as a long term, short term, or hookup which is immensely helpful. HOWEVER, all of these great features are COMPLETELY WORTHLESS when I am not matching with ANYONE and I can’t see the messages my matches are sending me. I must have swiped through 200+ with no matches AT ALL. NONE. That’s incredibly abnormal based on my use of Tinder up to this point. One match who I was really interested in and talked to for a day, I couldn’t see his messages at all when he was trying to contact me after our first initial chat. Luckily I was able to reconnect with him on Instagram after I realized I wasn’t seeing his messages. He then sent me a screenshot that showed all the messages he sent that I did not receive. I’m not sure if these issues apply exclusively to the app though because I tried on their site and had the same problems. And I must have messed with my settings and deleted and reinstalled the app on my phone 10 times, and still nothing worked. The match I reconnected with told me Tinder has also been buggy for him as well. FIX YOUR APP, TINDER.",misfitglory182
Tinder,2022-12-17 10:41:02,Admitted to banning my by accident - now blocked forever,1,"I’m like the thousands of others who left a one star review about being banned for no reason at all. My account was banned. I have the most vanilla account on the planet and was certain it was an error. Tinder responded and admitted it was their error and that my account was banned (forever) because it was accidentally flagged as a spam account. Then they proceed to tell me to sign up again, but that’s impossible because you have to use your phone number to sign up (you can’t use a burn number) and my phone number is forever banned. So thanks Tinder for having the worst algorithm on the planet that bans real accounts FOREVER with no way for those people to ever get back on the app. You have an obligation to have a more sensitive and compassionate process around this. You know many of the people on your app are already feeling rejected, lonely, and depressed, and you make it worse by banning them from a way to connect with others and accusing them of doing something they didn’t do. It’s so wrong on so many levels. I mean does anyone on your team actually read these reviews?! You would think you would change the process of banning accounts by now given the thousands of complaints that say they all experienced the exact same thing.",Loren KLD
Tinder,2021-11-09 17:43:48,Banned for no reason/without explanation,1,"I have noticed that tinder doesn’t reply to these. Many of my friend use this app and have noticed they will randomly get banned after paying, as it happened to me as well. I personally think they either need to set up a appeal process or renew everything on the app process. I know tinder isn’t about to even reply to this, but I just want it to be known that all of my friends are coming over to one Star this app until they set something up to make this process better for everyone. It is honestly ridiculous you can let people looking for thirds who play themselves as females to harass people about it or you get the people who will just report you for not replying why is that even an option on the reporting. Sometimes people can’t reply because the app is so freaking glitchy that messages sometimes don’t appear. Y’all advertise tinder as a great app but in reality if people are always complaining from what I’ve noticed about the glitching or having to get whole new numbers and phones to make a new account. It’s honestly sad seeing how bad this app can get like how do you not have a support line or even email that gives people an actual reasoning to why they were banned ect.

Tinder,2021-11-07 14:19:21,Worst Dating App with no way to get unbanned,1,"I had this app for over a few years. Then one day someone got my profile information and started uploading explicit pictures on my profile. Instead of emailing me, texting me, or trying to contact me about the situation they banned my account. I went to Tinders website to try and plead my case and repeal their decision. I could not find any such place on their website except a customer service email. I emailed them to try and and explain my situation, but was left with “at this time there is no repeal process put in place to allow someone the opportunity to be unbanned”. I don’t understand how in a world where people are constantly getting hacked that they have no plan or repeal process for situations like this. I tried making a new account with a new email and tried making new social media’s. Unfortunately they have linked my banned account to my phone and everything on my phone. It’s fine, I’ll spend my time, energy, and money on different apps like bumble and hinge. This inferior app has so many other problems with it, I’m sure I won’t miss it. Will never recommend this to anyone looking to use dating apps. I will always tell people from now on not to use this one because of the constant sexually charged males harassing women over this app.",TD0625
Tinder,2022-05-29 07:58:13,On the Decline - New Features Make it Buggy and Unuseable,1,"UPDATE: App is completely useless and unusable now. Every time I send a message, it doesn't show up in the chat. Any time I type a message, the keyboard glitches and lags. App constantly crashes and freezes. Pictures and videos get removed for no reason, without any explanation why. Matches will randomly disappear and reappear again. This is with the most CURRENT and UP TO DATE version. Deleting this app now. 

Previous review:
Tinder used to be a simple app - fast loading, easy to use, worth paying the cheap price for premium. It was perfect 5 years ago. Now the app has added so many over the top, ridiculous, useless features that everyone hates. Other users on the app immediately give you their phone number or social media handle right away because the app is so bad. Messages don't refresh unless you close and reopen the app several times, trying to type has significant lag and delay, the app randomly freezes and crashes constantly. If you listen to music while using it, it will cause your music to glitch too. My phone has been significantly slower since downloading the app, its like simulating what an iPhone virus would be like. Overall an irritating, buggy, glitchy, slow app that gets worse every update.",sixcollars
Tinder,2021-04-08 04:12:30,Tinder is a scam,1,"I wish I’d have read the other reviews before paying for the “Gold” package. I recently went through a break up and considering I’m not from the place I am now living I thought I’d jump on Tinder and meet some people. I literally was only trying to meet people for friendship. Things are going okay, I’ve met a couple cool people, shared some music, seems all good, open the app up about 4-5 days later: YOUR ACCOUNT HAS BEEN BANNED. For absolutely no reason at all. I read every single word it the terms of agreement and the guidelines, I did not violate a single one. I was never disrespectful to anyone, if someone never responded to my “hello” or stopped responding when we were messaging back and forth I wouldn’t send another message, I wasn’t even on the app to find hook ups in the first place. Tinder is operating outside the lines of good business practice. You can’t contact them in any meaningful way whatsoever, they have no appeal process, nothing. Tinder is a sham. Apple should be ashamed of themselves for even allowing them in the App Store. I have now read through hundreds of reviews, Reddit and Quora posts and posts elsewhere explains this exact same situation. Tinder is banning paying customers for no reason, with no explanation and keeping their money. They are taking advantage of people simply looking to meet other people. Tinder is trash.",JunkMonster86
Tinder,2023-03-04 22:05:04,Completely fraudulent,1,"I’m far from the only person who experienced this, but in case someone who doesn’t know and is thinking of getting this app is reading this: Tinder and pretty much all dating apps are scams to get you to shell out money to them and keep shelling out money to them. They prey on loneliness. Maybe once they worked, but not anymore. You sign up with a basic account, no money, and you see you’re getting likes. Then you pay for a membership and the likes disappear. And no matter how much you swipe, super like, or boost, they don’t come back. It took me too long to realize that Tinder’s hope is that you’ll pay them more money after paying for a subscription. And they’ll do anything, including lie about their predatory business practices, in order to bleed you dry. Especially if you’re a guy, you have next to no chance of finding love on this app. Stay away from Tinder, Hinge, and any other dating apps run by the “Match Group.” They’re not really dating apps anymore. They’re money farms that use people’s - especially men’s - loneliness to make money. I can’t think of anything more despicable and demoralizing. Save yourself the money and the heartache. Do not, under any circumstances, download a dating app. But if you must download a dating app, download a different one than this.",JustACityBoy96
Tinder,2021-08-14 12:11:00,Terrible App,1,"To start things off Tinder is filled with bots, every second match I get in tinder is some “girl” trying to give you a massage and send you to a website. They don’t do any background checks on the people who join to make sure they are human. Secondly they spam it with advertisements and every 7th person you swipe on is an ad. Thirdly the amount of times it tells you, “you need to upgrade to get women to match with you” is incredibly annoying. Fourth, if you swipe right on everyone on the app Tinder actually throttles how many people you can match with. The first day I ran a test and swiped on every girl, I managed to go through about 40 women before it said I’m out of swipes. Next day I do it and get about 20. Now when I load the app I swipe on about 4 women before I have to upgrade my account because Ive ran out of swipes. It’s very unfair and flawed. Lastly they have these stupid “swipe surges” and other random events that “guarantee you’ll
match with someone.” Ive gone to about 4 of these events (and by go I mean had the app open) and haven’t matched with anyone, and yes I know it’s all about appearances, and I wouldn’t say I’m ugly nor attractive but still. This app is a huge scam, waste of time, try something like Bumble or Facebook Dating. 1000% better than this trash app.",Jay'sCraft
Tinder,2021-06-19 04:53:14,Banned for no reason,1,"Update: I’m afraid I also have been banned for no reason. I used to read these reviews and roll my eyes like people can’t be banned for no reason — must have done something. Nope. I’ve been permanently banned for absolutely nothing. I’m never even remotely mean or inappropriate. It must be an automated system when someone claims anything. Which is not a business I want to support. Maybe an ex saw me or something. After 6 years and many subscriptions, tinder has lost me permanently. Sad to say but it’s ironically not my choice ———————— Used to be decent. Now they’re giving out free passport apparently? But you can’t control if you swipe on people genuinely local, or those using passport “pretending” to be local actually 8k miles away. So now, 19/20 swipes are from random profiles around the world. Different languages, countries, with high language barrier and zero intention to come to your area. It has completely ruined the entire experience and made it impossible to use tinder for what it was created to do — get to know people around you to find a partner / friends. Not make virtual pen pals who are messing around. Add in the horrific allegations about their CEO, their horrible customer service, and pathetic squeeze for money, this is how a five star app became useless, nearly overnight.",Da Saber
Tinder,2022-04-20 13:09:55,Absolutely Terrible!!,1,"Tinder has so many glitches it is not even funny. I had so many issues with the site. At some point in time, Tinder decided to just stop my account from working. I was texting a couple matches who verified all our messages disappeared and they weren’t receiving any of my messages. I tried messaging Tinder and no response.

I decided to delete the old account and create a new account losing all my contacts from before. After creating a new account, someone flagged my new account, and got put on a hold for a bit with no reason why or anything. It apparently got squared away after a day again with no explanation. Now out of the blue, Tinder once again just banned me permanently for no reason while I was talking to a few people that could have been real connections! 

Now when I try to log on or create an account it says I am permanently banned! I am still trying to wrap my head around it, but I wouldn’t use Tinder ever again after this experience! The sad thing is that there were some really great connections I had made and was in the process and either meeting or about to text before all of this went down and no way now for me to connect with them!

Tinder,2022-06-05 14:44:25,Too buggy for all the money they take in,3,"I’m not going to list the myriad reasons why tinder is a sub par service, just the app itself.
The app is built to constantly market boost and super like purchases to customers and it’s incredibly annoying. Almost every other time you tap through someones profile you get a large pop up prompt asking you to super like them, which always blocks out location information. Same with liking popular users. In my opinion, a premium paying user shouldn’t be constantly inundated with pop ups trying to siphon more money out of them.
There’s also issues with matching/chat functionality. Likes and messages are regularly dropped, which leads to situations where you think somebody is ignoring you but they just never even got your message. I’ve had a couple chats just get deleted wholesale as well.
For the amount of money this app takes in, it should be much more polished and reliable.
That being said I’ve gotten a couple decent hookups over the past month so I can’t completely hate it. Just be ready to deal with some frustrating bugs if you’re going to jump in",SmogMon

Tinder,2023-01-01 00:38:42,Money fishing app.,1,"I used tinder a few years ago, it was a lot different. I was getting likes on my profile every day, at least one, I paid for the gold once for a month and I eventually found a girl that I dated for the last 3 years. We split up and I chose to download tinder again assuming that I would have the same experience. This is not the case, now there’s 4 different memberships to choose from, you have to pay for everything. I started out for the first 2 months not paying a penny, I would get 3-4 likes on my profile a week at least. As soon as I paid for the gold membership for the last month, I have yet to receive a SINGLE like on my profile but I am getting tons more push notifications to buy or pay for boosts or super likes. Not to mention only about 1/6 people that do like my profile don’t send me a message at all, leading me to believe those are the fake profiles that tinder makes to keep people hooked on buying and paying for extra stuff. I’m not an ugly guy either, I know I’m not that boring to talk to either as I don’t ask dead end questions or talk about myself almost at all unless asked. I do not recommend to use this app unless you are casually swiping and don’t mind being bombarded with ads to pay for things.",Caden Lyman

I didn’t have any inappropriate photos of myself, wasn’t rude to anyone & always just had friendly conversations. I sent an email- my appeal and they wouldn’t let me know why I was banned and just told me I “violated the users guidelines agreement”. If you’re going to ban me for whatever reason, at least let me know why I was. I’ve heard this happened to a few of my other friends for no reason at all too. I think that is extremely annoying because you cannot make a new account unless you change your apple ID or phone number. I wouldn’t have minded if it let me go back on after a certain amount of days but i’m now banned for life I guess. I quite frankly really enjoyed the app as well. Although it’s a HOOKUP app, I’ve made some really good friends on that app. And considering that it is a HOOKUP app, I don’t see why I was banned. I’ve had about 4-5 photos, would change my photos frequently and update my bio whenever I got bored of what I had. So it wasn’t like I was a scam or bot.

With cell service and a strong internet connection. That’s if you’re lucky enough to keep an account. Tinder has now autologged me out and deleted every trace of 3 different accounts, totally unrecoverable. To add, I can’t even imagine the amateurism it requires to have an app so completely broken and to not even have a way to contact support to resolve any of your issues, that are conveniently unaddressed on their “support forums”. Forget it, lol, there are a million better, and more time efficient, ways to find a partner than wasting your time on an app that doesn’t even work... and is more focused on physiologically profiling (and profiting off) you and selling you a premium product (of a service that already doesn’t work??) than providing the service it claims it does",Anon8293929

I was banned for unforeseen reasons and no given no means of correcting this issue and was even about to pay premium for this app before I got banned. Used to tinder for three years and I have no clue why my account was banned so I am probably going to do the same thing again somewhere else. You can’t make another profile because it all connects through Facebook.

No warning and no indication of what you supposedly did.  If you are a paying Member, and you get banned they keep your money with no refund.  With people easily offended, and the ease to report another Member on the app, just stating in your profile that you’re “super straight” will eventually trigger some people as offensive and will report you as offensive behavior and you will get banned for life.  Of course you have to be a match to report someone, but people can match just for the purpose of reporting you because they are offended by information in your profile; political views, race, age, sexuality, and once matched, report you as offensive.  Also they are shady on their Membership costs and overcharge more than what they quote.  Before I became a paying Member, I would get pop ups of their Membership packages (months/cost).  First time I bought a 6mo gold package and was charged a little more than the cost quoted in the pop up.

Tinder,2021-06-08 19:41:23,I got banned for no reason,1,"I don’t understand the terms and policy of this app what so ever. I was banned for no reason. All of my photos are appropriate and my bio did not have anything close to being worthy of being banned.
It seems like tinder has a very flawed system in which it bans whoever it likes without giving any warning or notifications on why you were banned. This is an abuse of power right here from an app that has too much power. You can’t even appeal the reason why you were banned. It just doesn’t make sense to me. I’ve had my profile since 2015. I have deleted it every now and then to take a break from it. But redownloading it recently and have been using it for the past week, everything was fine. Until today, this afternoon I went onto the app to find out I was banned.
If this is how Tinder works and does things, by asking for personal information, wanting a bio and having you do so much to make a profile, just seems like a huge breach of privacy and an abuse of power.
I recommend anyone that wants to use this app, to not even download it. Because the amount of times I’ve seen my friends use this app, just to get banned for no reason, kind of blows my mind. Again, I highly suggest no one downloads this app at all.",SeekAndDes7roy2
Tinder,2023-03-13 20:49:06,Customer Services is PATHETIC,1,"I was banned from Tinder for absolutely nothing. I have had the app for a while and as sad as it is to save I’ve even paid for it for a few months. I never even come close to violating the terms or conditions. I’m genuinely trying to build connections on the app, which is probably where I went wrong. But anyway I was randomly blocked this weekend so as any normal person would do I reached out to customer services to see if maybe they could help explain to me what had happened. After going back and forth with them simply asking for a explanation and receiving the same auto generated response of “Your account has been banned from Tinder for violating our Terms of Use and/or Community Guidelines”, I was told that “We are unable to provide further assistance, and so we may not respond to additional requests about this case”. Excuse me? I’m asking for an answer about MY account and why I can not appeal this. Customer service was absolutely the worst I have ever worked with. There are men on Tinder who assault women they meet on the app & are reported but somehow they continue to have an account. There are men who have their 🍆 just on their profile yet they’re still on there. ALL i’m asking for is an explanation Tinder, that’s it.",FriendlyMaker77
Tinder,2022-11-22 17:16:32,Shallow and Fruitless,1,"Imagine a slot machine where you invest your time, money, and dignity only to receive fleeting moments of self-worth while gradually deteriorating your self-esteem until you’re hardly sure of your own value. This is Tinder. I have paid for Tinder platinum for 3 months now, I have spent countless hours swiping, editing and adjusting every small detail of my profile, used all the boosts and super likes and still have ultimately made little to zero progress in the dating realm. Now I know what you’re thinking, I must be doing something wrong, being creepy, boring, or not posting the right pictures or something but I try my best to avoid those specific issues as best as possible. I’ve had more success on hinge without even paying a dime for their service and yet here it feels like they are constantly demanding you for money just to be slightly prioritized for a very short period of time. Not to mention the sheer amount of bots, fake accounts, and people simply not using the app, or only using it to promote their brand is frustrating to say the least. I’m just not sure there’s much you can get from this app other than shallow physical encounters. There is not one other app that has caused me such mental anguish.

Tinder,2022-06-05 06:28:06,Problems for the Radar,2,"I think its problematic that I see people lower than my selected age range. Period. Or even higher, though both have gotten better (noticeably!)  Also, I understand corporate business/marketing, but it would be nice to see more people in my area vs people thousands of miles away. It's frustrating knowing there are so many local options but I'm seeing people from Colombia and Australia as someone who lives in the Midwest. I KNOW the company wants to get people to pay for the premium/passport, but I'm here to actually find connections with people in my area; people I have colloquial things in common with, vs people across the world. Ultimately, the success of the users of this app in finding people to interact with is going to the best for the brand, long-term. I know many people are starting to delete their Tinder app because it's not as locally effective, like Hinge or Grindr. Also, the option to accept 'passport' accounts would be nice, that way we actually know what is going to appear on our profile, as far as distance relative to our location.

Tinder,2020-11-08 23:32:36,Waste of money. Hinge or Bumble is better.,1,"I hope the developers read this. I pay for Tinder Gold ($30/month, I will be unsubscribing soon). This is most expensive “paid” version of this app. I regularly “match” with paid advertisements who look like young single women. These are Paid advertisements facilitated / sold by Tinder. Should a paying “gold” user be getting hit with adds? No. Additionally, I regularly match/see women who are all 80-99 miles away. I have my radius set to 40 miles. I’m not interested in matching with someone who lives two states and a three hour drive away. Also, about 10-20% of the female profiles on Finder are fake/scammers who immediately want you to add some obscure social media account name that doesn’t match their Tinder name or picture. The app also crashes frequently (yes, it’s fully updated). If you’re looking to spend money on a dating app, you’d be better off spending money on Hinge or Bumble. Use the free version if Tinder if you like, but they don’t deserve your money.

Tinder,2022-03-06 17:29:27,Banned for no reason,1,"I’ve used tinder frequently throughout the years. I have always been appropriate with how I approach my matches. Recently, I had re-signed up for tinder after deleting the app from a few months ago. When I downloaded the app I bought tinders gold feature. After a week or so of using the app I was prompted to get photo verified and I submitted my picture then. After waiting an entire day of not being able to access the app because my photo was still under review I sent their customer support an email message about the issue. Later the same day, i still had received no response back but was able to again access the app. A day later I was prompted that my account was banned. Between getting photo verified and being banned I messaged zero people and before that I had not in weeks if at all after my initial download of the app. I tried to reach out to their customer service via phone and I received busy signals, I reached out again using email and have not gotten a response. This was an extremely frustrating situation that do not completely understand myself but I have moved on from it.

Tinder,2023-03-09 04:31:16,The worst dating app imo,1,"I’ve deleted and reinstalled this app a few times and the experience is always the same. When you first create a profile, it shows you to a bunch of people at once and you get a ton of likes in a suspiciously short amount of time. You can spend months swiping and will never get the chance to match with these initial likes and you won’t see them unless you pay for a premium subscription. When you do, you discover that the likes you got were either scammers, people not in your area, or people you wouldn’t have matched with anyway. On top of that, after you get gold and can see your likes, they completely stop coming in. This is their opportunity to sell you the boosts so that you can be seen again. The whole thing is precisely designed to siphon money from lonely men and just feels gross. 

Now, in fairness, I have a couple friends who seem to have a little success on Tinder, which is why I keep getting suckered into giving it another shot, but for me, it has proven the most expensive and least fruitful of all the dating apps I’ve tried. I have managed to get dates from Hinge, Bumble and CMB without paying a dime and not one from Tinder after $90, so my suggestion would be to try any of those.",lingo3echo

I’ve had the app on and off over several years, and it used to function fine and give off the impression of being fair in presenting potential matches. In the past couple years they have somehow taken a perfectly decent app and ruined it. The app is very clearly now about maximizing profit at the expense of the user. This is made abundantly clear by shoving paid features down our throats and showing higher quantities of higher liked users only to paying members. Meanwhile non-paid members are left with a limited experience and fewer matches. The decision makers at Tinder are insulting the user’s intelligence by thinking we won’t notice it. The users notice this and are vacating the app. The user base is clearly not as alive as it used to be and I’m sure Tinder sees declining numbers in there regular user count reports. And after putting up with all of this, they have the nerve to randomly ban and delete my account, with zero warning or explanation, thus deleting all conversations I had going. If any other app developers want an example of how to take a decent app and run it into the ground, look not further than Tinder.",dissappointed user 55372

Then just put “polyamorous” as my “about me “ section as a placeholder until I could come up with more to say about myself. Then I swiped some. I looked at tons of profiles. Some for many minutes because I was on the phone on a call as well. I got a few matches. Then the app said I didn’t have any swipes left. And I hung around on the app trying to swipe more, looking at the plans that it offered and just around the app. Then it randomly popped up that I needed a photo  verification. And I assumed it was because I swiped too fast and it thought I was a bot or something. So I took the pics in the positions. I was in a car with the inside lights on-so not the best lighting. Eventually the screen that was blocking  me from using the app and processing the verified went away. And I looked at the app for another minute. But then it blocked out my screen and told me I was banned. I’ve reached out to support and they have basically said they can’t do anything. Like?????? You can’t review my profile?

Everything was going great until I woke up one morning and was literally just randomly banned. I hadn’t initiated in conversations in 2 or so days, and there was not a SINGLE thing on my account or in my bio that would ever get someone banned. In fact, I actually had a pretty boring account lol. When I went to appeal because obviously accidents happen, I found out there is no appeal process. Red flag number 1. Concerned, I emailed their “support team” just to get a run around and pretty much them telling they couldn’t do anything. Red flag number 2. Lastly, when I simply asked for my money back if they literally cannot provide the reason why I was banned, they responded with “ Your account has been banned for violations of our Terms of Use or Community Guidelines, which we take very seriously.

Within 4 hours of signing up and paying the high subscription fee, I was banned. No explanation or warning. Now I am in a battle to get my money back for the 4 hours I got use the service. In the 4 hours I learned that most profiles are couples looking for hookups with single girls. I learned that you are shown profiles no where near you. I learned that profile types that you exclude in your setting, are still shown to you. Tinder is failing as a platform and as a business model. Now I know why I never hear anyone talk about their latest tinder date. It’s because you can’t actually find anyone on tinder. It’s become a time warning swipe app. No one on the app actually pays for the service, so it’s impossible to match with a true person of interest. Search the internet and all you find is negative stories about the service tinder provides. Tons of comments on getting banned. Don’t waste your time, there are better dating apps out there!
How can Apple allow this app to stay on its service? They must get tired of the refund request after everyone getting banned.",themike3
Tinder,2020-11-18 17:20:05,By far the worst / trashiest app with worse customer service than Walmart,1,"I've been paying for Tinder Gold for months now, and have always battled between wanting to delete the app or keeping it in ""hopes"" I'd meet someone with some substance. Is it easy to pull someone from it? For sure. 

However you're much more likely to match with scammers (that have tried to blackmail me for $5k) or fake accounts ""promoting"" their Snapchat premium accounts. Upon attempting to report these accounts, they stay up, and even attempting to notify tinder about them they never seem to care (typical). 

Now I've been banned from tinder (with my subscription just now charging me) for no reason, whereas I unfortunately had to stand up a girl at 10pm somewhere because I couldn't contact her. The app froze on my phone, so in order to get in touch with this young lady, I attempted to log into my account from my friend's phone. Upon doing the text verification , it logged me out then when my app unfroze, said I was banned. I attempted to write tinder about it, but only received an automated ""screw you"" type email. Absolutely pathetic. Especially when they advertise to ""be more than a dating app."" They made it very easy to make the decision to delete the trashy app.",dbrii6482

And with the ban being pretty much permanent (as Tinder has no appeals process at the moment), I gotta say, sounds like a pretty good way to decrease user count when I think the success of an app probably depends greatly on having many satisfied people using your app? I hope developers are considering this and are AT LEAST trying to implement a formal appeals process. Even an e-mail explaining what particularly caused the ban would be better than the nothing myself and others have received. I would have liked a chance to at least address what it was Tinder thinks I’m doing wrong. This is a pretty big deterrent from my wanting to use the app again in the future when possible or recommend it to others.

Other than almost constant crashing (and the ban of course), I found the simplicity and easy use of Tinder appealing. No big complaints on that end, but with this inexplicable ban rendering my account unusable from now on, you guys are getting one star from me until you can figure out a way for users who weren’t violating TOS or community guidelines to get their accounts back.",Anitron

I just don’t like be rejected in person, so online dating seem like a good fit. But everything tinder advertises is a lie (for men). In a nutshell, it’s manipulative, it’s buggy, but most of all it just doesn’t work. The app will not push you out, even if you pay, and even if they did, the female to male ratios is said to be 1:9 to 1:15, but if you think about how many accounts are bots, or scams, the ratios are significantly worst, 1:50 seems like an exaggeration, but from my perspective it’s being generous. And that’s what makes the platform not work. It’s artificially inflated, bloat. I’ve used all the features, and in theory a lot of them are awesome, but they all don’t make you any more successful in finding a date because of those ratios. If you go to the clubs, at least your ratios are 1:1, I’ve grown as a person over the year, and I’ve had more success on 1 night at the clubs then my entire experience using tinder.

Tinder,2023-01-12 14:42:33,worst dating app experience - scarred,1,"this has been the worst and most heartbreaking experience I’ve ever had with an app or a service. My account was banned out of the blue, with no warning or indication what I did to violate the policies. I’ve reached out multiple times to support and just been flatly told that there is no appeals process and no way that they will tell me I did to be banned. 

Aside from this being a completely humiliating, violating and and frustrating experience, I’ve received so many times graphic violent and sexual messages from men on this app and had my reports be dismissed and never taken seriously. I have always conducted myself as respectful and more conservative and I’m literally speechless as to what happened to have led to this outcome. 

On top of everything, my phone is still receiving notifications from the app of new messages and new matches clearly indicating that my profile is still up and active, I’m just blocked from accessing it. This is literally a scam platform, keeping up profiles to look like their user base is much larger while blocking people and refusing to provide a semblance of customer support for someone who even paid for tinder gold at the time I was blocked and additionally was not refunded.",arkistudent

I went through all the community guidelines as terms of service as well and couldn’t find anything that I could have possibly done to break a rule. If the app at least allowed appeals and told me what I’d supposedly done wrong then fine, but it’s nearly impossible to contact any non-automated customer service and they refuse to tell you why you’ve been banned even if you do manage to somehow receive a human response.

Now, the word ""roast"" in this context, by definition, means, ""subject to GOOD-NATURED ridicule."" Now I matched with a woman who went by the name of Echo. Echo tried to roast me by asking if I was either a ""men's rights activist"" or ""really into anime."" I proceeded to ask if that was a roast, to which she assured me it was. SHE THEN ASKED ME TO ROAST HER BACK. I then said she looked like Roz from Monsters Inc, which again, is a GOOD-NATURED roast. If I thought she was a young lady that didn't appeal to me, then I wouldn't have swiped right in the first place. Obviously, this means that it was a light-hearted, good-natured comment, but one that Echo took as an insult to her very being. She then proceeded to talk about how she was comparing me to ""Nazis"" and a ""porn freak."" Those comments sound a lot harsher than me comparing her to a fictional character. Why I was the one being banned for this is beyond me, but in this situation, I feel like I have been wrongfully banned, when what I said wasn't nearly as bad as what she said.

And they give you the run around with zero help or process to help. And how convenient they banned me 1 week after they renewed my membership (which continues to go up in price every few months.) And even worse they choose to ban people randomly without warning or anything… while anybody that’s spent more than 3 minutes on the app knows the vitriol on here but nothing is done about that… the amount of people using it just to promote paying for sex, only fans, or scam fake accounts… but they randomly ban people without warning or any explanation is baffling.

There’s no call number, it took ten minutes ten find a place to send an appeal contact, after after all of that i am still banned from this app. This app does not care about users to truly want to find partners or any other consensual interactions with other users.

The appeal process doesn’t exist they simply will tell you they are not accepting appeals at the time and will not provide you with any information on why you have been banned besides vaguely stating that you have violated the terms and conditions. If you look through the reviews on this app you’ll find that it’s a pretty common problem that they will ban your account for seemingly no reason.
Honestly, what bugs me isn’t the fact that I’m banned from Tinder I hardly even use Tinder. I use Hinge mainly, however since I was banned in Tinder, Hinge received this information and decided to ban me from their app as well. So because of Tinder wrongly banning me I’ve now been banned from this app and the app I actually want to use (Hinge) with seemly no way to fix it.

Every time I try and type a message to someone, my typing lags and then whatever I wrote will randomly pop up 5-10 seconds later.

It’s like every time I try to use this app, something glitches and it makes my experience horrible. I was able to handle the overwhelming lagginess for a while, but now that I can’t even read a message without having to delete and redownload feels completely unacceptable from an app this widely used. And it isn’t an issue with my phone since I got a new one recently and it’s STILL happening.

What used to be a fun and reliable way to meet girls of all types with different interests became an unfortunate hub for unsuspecting males being cancelled without warning, without notice. Sadly, Tinder is the biggest and the most well known place for dating of all types but they are the opposite of a leader in society, by becoming selective in who gets to engage and enjoy dating life, which has become increasingly reliant on just one single outlet, which is mainly online, for some people, it is more than others, and dating is more online based in 2020 than ever before. In the past, we relied on a multitude of destinstions both physical and digitial in order to date and meet mates. How unfair is it that this seems like THE public square, through mostly no fault of our own, the ONLY public square for so many, yet some get banned for no good reason and don't get to date.

It takes forever to load conversations that I am trying to have real time, when opening the app via notification, it makes it even slower, it freezes from time to time forcing me to close the app and try again, the keyboard glitches out, and more. It makes trying to have a continuous conversation very hard. On top of that, a recent update with the option to allow video calls has made conversation hard. After a couple back and forth messages, a pop up will appear at the bottom of the screen, covering about 1/3 of the screen. It asks if you are fine with video calls with that specific person. I like that it seeks consent. The only way to get rid of the giant pop up is agreeing or disagreeing. When you open the keyboard with the pop up still there, it just moves up, covering your conversation. I used to like the app. But in the past year or so, it has gone downhill. The only reason I keep it is because it is the most commonly used app, meaning more chances of swiping. Otherwise, it’s not worth a lot of the effort the app forces on you.",lilbennay

Literally had a guy who is downlow, that came at me sexually(who knew Im non-binary with it clearly stated in my bio) and I didn’t give him any engagement, report that I was underage (I’m 30) and they banned me WHEN I DID NOTHING WEONG OR BREAK COMMUNITY GUIDELINES and when trying to appeal with customer service via email, I was told I have to send my PERSONAL I.D to a third party that’s not identified or known! I’m not sending a photo of my ID to a party I don’t know! for them to do who knows what with it! Tinder ban system is TRASH and bans individuals off baseless reports and doesn’t have a functioning appeal system! I have half a mind to seek legal action simply because of the unfair treatment of people of the trans and nonbinary experience by guys that have self entitlement thinking we owe them conversation and if we don’t, the consequences is being reported with the confidence we will get banned because of tinders lack of report filtering! I would advise users to stir clear from this app! You get reported, your banned with no questions asked!",La'Maaj
Tinder,2022-09-18 02:13:08,Bans for no reason and won’t let you appeal!,1,i’ve had tinder for awhile on and off. i recently decided to give it another go. i deleted my old account so i could start fresh. i made a new account and i guess they started a new verification system. it lagged and would not let me get though no matter how many times i tried. i did it 100+ times and wouldn’t work. just kept saying completed and would make me do it over again. i contacted support about the problem and they were no help at all! they said there was nothing they could do. well i tried again after a whole month of not letting me on! it finally worked and then as soon as i got on tinder flagged my account. probably because i had to go through verification so many times. then they notified me i was permanently banned! so i tried to message support explaining i did nothing wrong and i hadn’t even got to swipe on one person on the account. they kept saying i violated the guidelines (which i looked at and i didn’t violate any of them!) they refuse to give me back my account! which is such crap! i even offered to send them my personal ID to prove i am who i say i am. they are no help and refuse saying they don’t have an appeal process.🙄,Ahhhhhg nopeeee
Tinder,2020-09-05 08:04:39,"Glitched for two days, then banned out of nowhere.",1,"I’ve had Tinder Gold for a couple of years now. I took myself out of the stack about a month ago, and came back over the weekend. It resumed without a hitch until Tuesday. I found that my matches and messages were fluctuating, and that it stopped showing profiles in areas either at home or where I work. I just assumed the servers were slow/lagging. I got home from work tonight, and I started to see profiles again. I thought things were back up and running again. I hop on about an hour later and bam, I’m banned. From what I’ve read on my app and trying to log in on the computer, I’ve all of a sudden violated their terms of service somehow. It’s not like I can get a hold of anyone, as their emails are electronically responded to by bots, and after reading through some of these reviews, their App Store responses are the same. I’ve canceled my subscription which was coming up for renewal at the end of the month, so I suppose timing couldn’t have been better for me. Between this, the increasingly fake(snap, insta follows, sugar babies, cashapp/Venmo requesting) profiles, and the clear dead end when it comes bans and customer service/support, it’s been eye opening for sure. Best of luck everyone.",Se@n331
Tinder,2022-07-27 23:07:37,Horrible experiences,1,"I’ve had two horrible experiences with Tinder, needless to say they need to do better. 

Privacy was a huge issue in one of the insistences (Do Not add where you go to school!!!). Some random person on Tinder had included my name in a list and given my city’s school system suggesting that I may have sold someone’s pictures online and almost got expelled from undergrad without tinder doing proper investigations. Thankfully my school did and I’m assuming I was not found guilty of the accusations as I didn’t get expelled. 

Furthermore, my partner and I wanted to find a third consistent partner as that is the lifestyle we wish to live and have the right to do so. I’m assuming that tinder frowned upon this as both of our accounts were banned without the possibility of recreating an account to simply find friends or a connection individually. It would have been great to get a warning before being banned. We weren’t hurting anyone on the app, many people were willing to connect with us and had no issues. Why don’t you ban all of the creeps from the app who aren’t respectful? So disappointed… I was hoping to recreate an account to make new friends as I recently moved. Think it’s time to move on!",khaleesi8
Tinder,2021-05-23 12:07:57,ID Upload Issues,1,"I know this may be a regional requirement, but requiring an ID to communicate is both a good and bad idea.  It’s good to verify the age of a user to keep minors and adults from interacting.  Scanning in that much personally identifiable information is something that doesn’t sit well with me, however.  What happens to the scans at Tinder?
     In spite of this I uploaded my info to be able to communicate, and in thirty plus attempts to scan it in, it was not accepted once.  Everything was in the lines, and in focus but turned down each time. Additionally, the prompt for this pulled me out of the app and into my browser.  Don’t know if this was the reason or not for it not working, but either way it never worked.  Without this, I couldn’t talk to matches because the scan isn’t accepted.
     On top of this, I was paying for the subscription, which I don’t like in the first place, but it is what it is.  After about three weeks of hoping this would be sorted in an update, two weeks of which I had matches I couldn’t even communicate with, I decided enough is enough and deleted my account for the final time.  Don’t think I’ll be reenrolling, and can’t recommend this app to others.",Popcorn Fantasy
Tinder,2020-10-13 15:14:17,Tinder needs an appeals process ASAP-Banned for no reason,1,"I have been using tinder for years with no problem , and in the last week i decided to delete my account and make a new one so it could be refreshed. I feel like i was not getting as many likes or matches are i could. So i did that. I create my profile and everything is fine, then i go to sleep and wake up this morning to my account being banned for no reason. I didn’t do anything vulgar or post and bad pictures. My bio was not bad. And simply stated that I’m from London. I didn’t do anything to anyone. Had no conversations on this new account and It had been less than one day. If i can’t get my account back, I’ll have to leave a negative review unfortunately because I’ve seen countless other examples of people who have done nothing getting banned for no reason. And the fact that you come down so hard over nothing, and don’t provide an appeals process, is deplorable. Hopefully I will be able to get my account back as this app is something i enjoy Using to meet new people and there are not really any alternatives to it that i like. This review doesn’t take into account the sometimes shoddy algorithm when using the app, but that’s neither here nor there. FIX UP TINDER",Shelovesjess
Tinder,2022-12-06 13:31:27,Banned for no reason,1,"How am I supposed to address any of my main concerns if I have no way to contact support by email or phone? My account got banned a few months ago and I can’t think of any reason why i got banned. I have other people telling me that my account is still active, but I can no longer access it. So for all I know, someone is out there pretending to be me with all my pics & personal info. I get banned on there, but you guys can’t even close the account? Also, I’m seen a lot of unsolicited private pics from a few accounts that are still active and don’t get banned. Make it make sense. Tinder definitely doesn’t have our best interests if we can get banned for no reason and they still have accounts like that there are still active. The support is terrible. Something needs to change. I’ve used tinder for years and I’m super upset on how things are being handled. I can no longer create new profiles or have any access to my old accounts that I wish to be deleted. How are you gona claim that you want to have a safe plate form, yet allow things like that to happen? You guys really need to work on bettering your support system or you need to be shut down.",anonuser97
Tinder,2021-06-07 08:15:29,They never fix ANYTHING,2,"I’ve had the app for about 4 years now through college, and it’s been buggy since the first day i downloaded it. Will constantly crash, and it doesn’t seem they ever fix it. Currently i get profiles that say they’ve super liked me, but then after a right swipe, no match. This is just the beginning of the never ending bug cycle. But don’t worry about the bugs, they’ve already hatched up their new and improved membership plans! 🙄

Also good luck getting matches because, like I said the app never works properly. I’ve had a couple of successful meetups from the app, but they come in spurts. App is filled with mostly bot profiles and females who are “just looking for friends” or promoting IG and use Tinder as a power trip or confidence booster instead of its intended purposes. Also I’ve tested a theory a few times, and Tinder is just extremely inconsistent with its algorithm. One time I can have over 100 matches in a few months, and another time I’ll struggle to get 5 matches.

Sadly still probably the best dating app there is, which is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1, but you’d think in 2021 we could do better.",I Gotta iPhone
Tinder,2021-09-09 21:12:32,Im banned :(,3,"So I’d like to think im pretty good about following guidelines. Now I understand that this is my fault, but I jokingly told a guy I was 15. I planned to tell the guy the truth, but I went to sleep with no response to the message. The next day I get on and I am banned! I tried to contact tinder to explain that I was in fact a legal adult, and even sent a front and back photo i.d. But, it was too late, and they had told me that I would stay banned from the app permanently. I wish tinder would lock your account to verify age and identity, instead of completely banning you. Many of my friends have been banned off tinder for reasons they aren’t even sure of. I am certain that there was no other reason for my ban, and I really enjoy tinder and the concept of the app. It is really upsetting. Im not trying to warn people off the app, or trying to get myself unbanned. But im just mostly trying to maybe propose that you guys give warnings, or second chances for people that are being banned for identity or age concerns. I really don’t think I actually committed any violations.",angel </3
Tinder,2022-04-08 00:19:53,"Full of fake profiles, at least 90%!!! Scammers & prostitutes from out of your country!",1,"Is overrun with scammers now. Most of the messages I get are from women that cannot properly write in English, and my settings are set to just 5 miles from Los Angeles, ha ha. 

My parameters are very specific, but I still get girls from all over the country, using the same profile pictures, and the same ridiculous nonsensical opening remark. I finally started reporting them, pretty time-consuming. But as you know, as soon as you see a picture, you can tell if someone is on the other side of the world. Or you will start to see dozens and dozens of profiles using the same girl, ha ha. 

So, when I say local to LA, and it says they live in “California,“ I know they are fake. When locals in Los Angeles put their location, they do not write California, ha ha. Anyway, I thought it might backfire, reporting so many people. And it did! I went to look around yesterday, thought I would try again, come to find out I have been banned from the site.  Never said anything inappropriate, just looking for a nice local girl. But I guess they don’t want regular local people on there. They must be making money from the scammers.

Tinder,2022-04-07 02:51:38,Tinder is un-American,1,"This app does not like free speech. My account was banned for expressing free speech on my account. As an American my rights are inalienable. A online dating app shouldn’t have control over that in this regard nor should be able to filter what I say on my dating profile just because it offended someone. That’s not my problem if it offended someone. Tinder is no different than these other garbage online platforms like Twitter or Facebook with the censorship of our free speech and accounts as a whole. In online dating its import to have a bit oh honestly inside your profile. I believe this will help polarize people a little better towards me and ultimately get better matches that are in more alignment with what I believe in. Tinder banned my account for expressing my free speech. This is un-American and unconstitutional. This app has gone downhill exponentially since it’s inception.  I wouldn’t recommend this app due to the water downed quality of it, free speech censorship and the inferior design. Also, this app has a huge stigma of being the so called hookup app so nobody takes it seriously anymore. Definitely recommend Bumble over this app due to it having better features. Won’t ever use Tinder again.",FilmMaster1001
Tinder,2020-12-22 00:56:39,I hope the developers see this,1,"So I want to start off by saying, I had high hope for this app. Unfortunately, this is app has a lot of bugs and flaws. In the beginning I had several matches and I was like okay, this is getting really good. I started to have a conversation with a couple of the girls and I was getting ready to exchange numbers and all that. Then all of the sudden, there is no responds, I kept getting a few other matches after that and I would say something and I would get no response. So, today, someone hacked my account and I had to reset everything all over. I was like okay, fine. I started getting a lot of likes and I noticed that there was a green dot on right corner in my screen that indicated that I am online. I got a match and I started having a conversation with girl. After a couple of messages, I got no respond and then the green dot that was in the right corner of my screen vanished. I realized that this is a bug in the app. I am still receiving match’s but my messages does not go through. I want to say that this app is a money grab and I was very disappointed that I wasted my money on this app. I had high hopes but this will probably be the last month that I will subscribe tinder gold.",megasatan667
Tinder,2020-10-08 13:58:34,Terrible treatment,1,"Over quarantine I was casually swiping through tinder and matching with people to talk to and possibly go out with as soon as restrictions eased up. To my surprise one day I tried to log in and got told I was banned. I never posted any photos or anything in my bio that went against the guidelines. I also tried to keep my conversations with others on there clean and avoided any words that weren’t appropriate. I did update my bio the day before to say that if people didn’t support BLM to swipe left (since there unfortunately a lot of men I met on there that didn’t). I was given no warnings. I have no idea why I was banned and when I messaged the help center to ask why I was, their response was that they didn’t accept appeals and wouldn’t unban me. When I pressed further to ask why I had been, they wouldn’t even respond to me. Terrible customer service.  
At this point I have to assume I got banned for expressing my political views on there. Though I keep reading a bunch of other reviews of people who have had a similar experience to me. Yet Tinder still doesn’t have an appeals process for these instances? Tinder needs to do better. People should not be treated this way.",Autumn Kim
Tinder,2023-03-14 03:25:48,Tinder’s Downfall,1,"I’ve had Tinder off and on for years, and have even bought Gold on several occasions. Never really had any issues until 2 weeks ago. App became very glitchy and I was unable to use any of my features. Reached out to support after trouble shooting and received a response saying they have escalated the ticket. Two weeks later and I add additional comments to the ticket with no word back. I received the same automated response about the ticket being escalated.. now they’ve reached out saying I’ve been banned and am unable to use Tinder moving forward (no other explanation). I saw this coming- that what all the reviews have been saying for weeks, but it’s still baffling. I know I haven’t violated TOS. To think I still have “Gold” features on my account for the duration of the month but no way of using the app is sleazy. The old Tinder was better. The company’s really milked this app for all it’s worth and ruined their community for greed. Tinder really should be rewarding the user base for keeping alive an app that’s really scraping the bottom of the barrel with what it offers and the people they allow on it instead of hitting everyone with random BANS. Good riddance.",cienjdkebrjnexjj
Tinder,2023-01-21 18:07:29,Keep trying Tinder,1,"While Tender is free, the free feature is littered with scammers and bots that pretend to make the app seem like more than it is…it clearly isn’t.
It’s feels like they’re trying to punish users who don’t pay for any of their overpriced services by feeding them bots, (employees who try and rip off customers who are using the free feature), and con artists who try to lead people away from Tender into some other scam or featured platform that doesn’t lead to a meeting.
Having said that, I do meet new users who genuinely want to meet another living person. Sadly, it is becoming increasingly difficult to actually encounter a real person who also is really interested in meeting up.
I don’t see how this is supposed to encourage people to become paying customers. What happened to the Tender from 12 years ago? When you could find company for the evening on the same evening you were looking…sheesh!
Now you have to delete the app and reinstall it again just to get a new load of bots and profiles to sift through that are actually in your location…I’m thinking Tender actually died a long time ago and this is just the internet remnants of the original idea.",TallyTwhacker
Tinder,2020-09-10 00:43:06,Bans for no reason,1,"I’ve been using Tinder since it first came out and I thorough enjoyed the app! I actually met some really cool people which I still talk to. 

Now... this app is useless. I understand that people can be predatory but the practices that Tinder is doing is awful. They are banning people for no reason. In my case I got banned for nothing because the worst message I sent was “hey cutie”. My roommate got banned even though he didn’t message ANYONE. When I went online I saw that this problem was prolific and everywhere. They ban people for absolutely no reason and without any proof. If they receive one report, you’re done. So theoretically, a guy, who doesn’t have a good chance with the ladies, can lower the dating pool by making a fake account and reporting any dude they find to be more attractive than them. And when you try to email tinder about the situation, you get an automated reply and ZERO help at all. The email they sent me said “we do not check for what you did and we do not unban or review accounts.” This type of practice from Tinder is illogical and sexist. And it will eventually lead to the demise of this app. I cannot wait to see this app be removed from the App Store.",Fizzykhalifa

We’ve came across odd people, but don’t allow that to stop you from finding your soulmate even through an app. In life you’ll be bound to come across odd people.

Tinder,2020-11-15 05:18:32,Banned for no reason,1,"I’d hope the developer sees this. This app is fairly good. I can’t exactly complain other than the fact that I use to match with girls 100+ miles away from when my search radius is around 40 miles. I’m sorry but I don’t care to match with a girl that is 2 states away and sometimes in another country lol. I want to also add that i find it fairly ridiculous that I was banned for no reason I can think of nor did THEY give me a reason... On top of that, they have no way to appeal it. I’ve been on the website over the months and it says that, and I quote, “at the moment, we don’t offer a formal appeal process”. I could be wrong, surely I’m not, but this has been in development for a long time. I’d love to know when this is a thing. It makes me think that the developers don’t care enough about their users to want to even make something for appeals. Your customers must care enough about this app to want to try and appeal their ban. I’d love to know why I got banned in the first place anyways but they won’t tell me. I wouldn’t recommend this app to anyone. It’s ridiculous... the developers don’t care, they make you pay a rather ridiculous amount of money to even match with people.",jacks1821

I begin to have a great conversation with one of them, but for seemingly no reason and completely out of nowhere, the match and conversation disappeared, along with the second match which I had not even messaged yet. Neither of them could be found anywhere, and I have no idea why this happened. I know for a fact that I never said anything even vaguely inappropriate or offensive, so there was no reason for the one match to un-match with me. Ever since then I have not had more than two matches show up in the tab, despite buying plus, despite boosting, despite receiving notifications about new matches, and despite even trying to swipe right on everyone. Radio silence as far as I can tell. Tinder is at least kind enough to tell me that I have more likes I can view and match with if I buy Gold for $29/mo. No thanks. This app is rigged and will only give us crumbs compared to what we’re actually worth just so they can make more money off of our search for connection. I’ll be deleting after this pay period unless Tinder can show us that they’re really trying to be transparent in our dating interests.",$uperman708

So I come back when I turn 18 and I am still denied the right to use the app; “that’s okay” I thought “everyone makes mistakes. They could have made one too!” so I thought. I submit my ID, and now I am denied access to the platform even though I am 18 and have a valid ID? I emailed the “customer support” (not much help btw), and was told I “violated the terms or service” with no explanation. Not sure which term I violated? I guess they don’t get paid enough to tell you what you did wrong, only enough to tell you you’ve done wrong with no explanation (even when they decision is backed by no fallible evidence). I’m starting to think this company just rolls a dice when they let people join. I know plenty of 14-17 y/o’s on the platform with no trouble, but they somehow follow the “guidelines”. It’s embarrassing for a company to be so lazy and downright negligent when it comes to enforcing rules and paying employees to enforce them.

I personally value reviews from users because I’ve had terrible experiences with some applications. After reading that apparently they banned an account without cause or explanation is unsettling, but the fact they gave a generic response to the person when they reached out to support is totally bogus. And the fact they don’t have a support number with live reps make me discouraged. If you have ever had a problem with some program that had horrible support you know what I mean. I would rather use a glitchy buggy app with real people providing high quality support than a nice smooth friendly GUI app that has no support. I wish they would impose regulations mandating these companies to provide phone, email, and chat support. Besides think about it- a person who doesn’t support their product .... I know I take pride in things I do and lack of support says they don’t care about their product/service or their users. Step your game up and stop being greedy losers.

After my most recent relationship ended, I figured I would give Tinder another shot, as I did manage to go on a few nice dates with nice women when I lasted used it. Well, the place is now swarming with either fake profiles, or women that will “match” with you, only to then direct you to some external site for solicitation (ie onlyfans). I’m sure there are probably a few women on here that are real/decent, but I certainty haven’t found them after spending the last hour or so swiping left on almost every profile I came across. If you’re into paid “fun” or possibly being catfished by a 300lb guy that lives hundreds of miles away from you, this is the app for you.

The questions were also of the same nature; how long you been on and what u do. I think one reported me when I told her that only a bot would match some 50 year old man. NOW THAT ph # is BANNED.

I wrote that in my profile, then stated, that I was very grateful to all the suckers willing to pay for various fees. Got Banned the 1st time.

Then when you try to contact tinder to get clarification and get your account working again you either get no response at all or you some automated response that still tells you nothing. I have spent over $400 on this app in the last 4 months  and to have my account banned with no explanation and no option of fixing what ever issue it was is completely unfair. The only thing I’ve been able to find anywhere says that my acct probably got banned because in my bio I stated that my husband and i are looking for a 3rd ( a woman to be our girlfriend). First, there are literally TONS of accounts that say the exact same thing. Second, it’s very discriminatory of this app/site to ban people for seeking a polyamorous relationship vs a traditional monogamous one. It’s discrimination boron line no other way to put it. Going to find other more inclusive apps because I refuse to give another cent to a site that claims to be inclusive and even claims to be a swinging app and then bans ppl for nothing.

I never posted nor sent any inappropriate pictures, there was nothing vulgar on my page, just a couple of profile pics and like one or two sentences in my bio. I’m reading a lot of reviews of this happening to other people. I get that technical issues happen, and sometimes they even happen on a larger scale, but what really upsets me is seeing that Tinder has not responded to not a single review regarding this issue and I’ve even seen reviews where they’ve tried to email Tinder and received messages back saying they will not accept appeals nor offer any other options to get this issue fixed. Needless to say, I won’t be using this app anymore... one reason being that I’ve been banned for no reason whatsoever, but even if they fixed the issue by some miracle, since they don’t seem to like to do that, I probably still wouldn’t use it because who the heck treats its customers like that???

I open the app, and it tells me I’ve been banned. There is no reasoning given to me for why, just the general explanation that I may have violated terms of service or community guidelines. I didn’t. The ban was random.

Since then, I’ve emailed a few times over the last two years just to try and clear up the issue. As of December 2020, however, there is still no appeals process, and after getting an email that your request will be reviewed, almost immediately you get another generic response from the “Support” team that there isn’t an appeals process and that your request is resolved. That isn’t customer service at all, that’s just telling for the company that they have no interest in helping resolve cases of accidental bans (because I am not the first nor the last to have this happen to them) and communicate with the customer in general.

Even if you had tinder gold plus but it’s still the same. Most of the time it’s like someone liked me on the tinder like 3 to 4 people in a day but when I opened the app and there is no likes. What I’m thinking that they might like me or swiped me right but you guys are trying to take it off from me. Like giving me false hope and there is no likes. Who knows? Because maybe you want me to continuously use your plus membership monthly. No, but people should know if this is what you’re doing to them. And what is happening with me also happening to them, means I’m not wrong. Also I swiped everyone for 2 weeks like literally everyone. Yet not like back. At least one. Only one could like me back. But no one did. It doesn’t mean I may not look someone according to their interest. It also can mean that you took my every likes from them that they don’t know if I liked them or no. If this is how a business runs to take out the likes and make people keep using continuously the membership, then it’s the foulest thing that I ever seen.",Señor Sherzai
Tinder,2020-10-06 15:19:11,Probably not worth it.,1,"I’ve used this app a little...but once I felt brave enough to put myself out there, I uploaded all decent pictures that contained no lewdness at all and filled out basically everything I could think of on the profile (contained no vulgarity either). Experience was going okay for just a little bit, but as soon as I begin seeing I apparently had some likes on my profile one day then I’m locked out of the app/my profile and told I’ve been banned. No explanation or anything from the support team or anything like an email, nothing. I’ve asked many times to have my account reviewed so they can see nothing was wrong with my profile or the messages but they just kept stating that “you’ve been banned for violating our terms”. So, here I am still single and unable to use what I thought was a good app because Tinder felt I violated the app by casually using the app like most people would? Like I said, my profile contained no vulgar images or words or anything like that nor did the few rare messages I got to send. So I’m confused and upset with my experience. If you’re thinking about spending money on the app, reconsider as they might just ban you for no reason as well.",D.L.W.E
Tinder,2020-12-14 21:08:42,Could always be better,3,"Let me preface this by saying I’ve used a large amount of dating apps such as OKCupid, Plenty of Fish, Hinge, Meetme, and etc. over the span of 8 years but Tinder is probably the go to app; it’s fast, easy and pretty much condenses all that I want from most other apps into a simpler format. However, with this app being infamous for mainly hookups or casual encounters, the pickings for someone more substantial (platonic or romantic) is slim to say the least. As well, like in other apps, the amount of empty profiles or spam accounts overwhelms the amount of real people. I do wish that there was a sort of requirement of word count in each profile so that if someone IS serious about matching, they have a (somewhat) cohesive bio to show this. While I’ll always enjoy the interface and the simplicity of Tinder and don’t personally see myself off the app anytime soon (especially given the time I’m writing this) I do wish there were a more comprehensive way to weed out the casual from serious or the hookups from genuine friendships WITHOUT having to download yet another app.",MsGenki
Tinder,2021-08-16 19:04:23,WONT USE EVER AGAIN,1,after having my Tinder for a little less than six I go to get on the app and I am randomly banned after not having touched any of my photos or my bio. I try to reach out as to why I am banned and I ask specifically what terms and conditions did I violate and I’m met with some idiot they hired named Ashley and all Ashley can tell me is that I violated terms and conditions and she can’t tell me anything else completely ridiculous and utterly stupid. I tried to request a refund but that is no luck after spending $60 for the year subscription and not even getting to use half of the year. I wouldn’t recommend anyone spend a dime on this app as it’s ran by a complete idiots who just are trying to take your money and then kick you off the app and they won’t tell you a reason. if you’re going to take peoples money and then banned them from using the platform the very least you could do is bring some receipts to the table as to what the user did to violate the terms and conditions rather than having some idiot named Ashley repeatedly tell me I violated terms and conditions and nothing else. for the final time I don’t recommend anybody use this app.,PurpleTurtles14

You are choking off people who are willing to pay for your free app.,1,"(Very tempted to rate 5 stars hopping people who see this comment more but no) Im like a lot of other people In the reviews got permanent banned for no reason what so every. I have come to the conclusion that people are reporting others instead of “unmatching” cause a lot of people (including me) to lose their accounts. Specific in to my situation my Ex found my profile and share it will all her friend and simultaneously reported me. Tinder, I need you to listen to us. I’m not sure if this is your plan to get rid of old accounts ( which is needed) but there must be a better way. Update: it’s been two weeks and I’m banned again. HOW? I don’t understand you tinder. Yes you want to get rid of fake accounts and parody account but for people who you wrongly banned......they have to make new accounts 😮 . They have no choice but to make a second account because they really believe in your service in your app. I really hope who over manages timers customer reviews see this. *YOU GOT TO CHANGE THE ALGORITHM * you are choking out potential premium subscribers and tinder plus users.",Swagadyswag
Tinder,2022-07-31 06:36:34,It’s become a money Grab,1,"Been on tinder for years. Have had success, and frustrating moments. Recently fired it back up just to realize the entire thing is set up for you to get the $40 monthly service, or at least the $30 one. Got the $10 one thinking unlimited likes would be enough, and although I’ve gotten matches, my “likes section” is stuck at 20. I’ve swiped for hours and barley see it go down, and barley get any more matches, yet apparently there are 20 people who've liked me and are stuck ion my waiting list, essentially. So basically forcing me to either pay another $20 to see my likes and matches, or for an extra $30, ensure that my likes get to the front of the line. I’m telling you, I’ve swiped hundreds of times and nothing. So it’s either purposefully keeping my matches from me, or the system is blatantly lying and displaying the same number of likes even when I don’t like a potential match that has already liked me. It’s crazy that a scam like this is legal, and even has the label of Editors Choice. Other dating apps have tiered subscriptions too, but they don’t stoop this low. This is just bad, and should just be illegal.",Coolfood6
Tinder,2020-09-21 02:20:35,"More like, Bug Night",1,"I’ve seen some other reviews mentioning the fact they completely broke their app with this update so I’ll just move on to the review of Swipe Night. It’s worse than any B-movie i’ve ever seen. I never thought you could make a story where the protagonist is background extras. First of all, cell phones don’t have static because they’re not analog TVs, so the glitching effect makes no sense. All the ambulances you see are from the 1970s because that’s all they had access to I guess. The sets are tiny and empty, I guess because the portrait aspect ratio doesn’t allow you to see much of the environment, so maybe that’s actually good filmmaking then. Obviously the acting is terrible and they try way to hard to make people sound “hip” and cool. Maybe they based the dialog on all y’all’s chat logs and some of you really talk like that. It’s really ironic that the app won’t let me click anything but the Swipe Night video plays fine. I was so bored I sat through a decent chunk of it until the bugs came back and I couldn’t swipe to make a choice anymore. Oh also I HIGHLY doubt that view counter is real. there’s no way over a million people could pay attention to that Z-movie.",MrFrostingbutt
Tinder,2023-01-14 15:28:06,Bottom of the barrel.. worst app out there.,1,"Updated Review: Tinder has resorted to using notifications, indicating “You have a new match!” in order to get users to go into the app. Upon opening the application, there is no new match waiting for me. They have reached new lows and only care about the number of times the application is open. Tinder is a complete waste of time. 

Old Review: Every account is fake (verified or not), and the notifications are trash. It’ll say “You have one new match!” And when I turn to open the app, there is no new match there. On the rare occasions I do get a match, the notification says “Someone” sent me a contact card and a quick message. Most of the time, it’s a link for a social media account and a suggestion to reach out to them that way (which leads me to believe it’s for money). No faith in this app and will not spend money for it. It won’t make a difference. Do better and maybe I’ll change my mind. Update: this app is still the worst. Fake “matches” and automatically gone in seconds. I firmly believe it is just for the purpose to show people are using the app and that tinder is still relevant. What a joke.",The Texas Rattlesnake
Tinder,2022-01-25 12:41:09,Save yourself your money and time,1,"Tinder isn’t what it used to be. It’s become a scam. The experience is just like talking to a sales person. “Oh hey someone liked you, wanna see them? It’s only $25 a month.” “On top of that it’s only an extra $5 a month and we’ll show you to more people.” “Want a boost? It’s only $7 for this many.” They don’t care about their consumers, why would they want to? If you don’t get a match and meet someone you will still be a consumer, and as soon as you meet someone, they don’t get your money anymore. It would actually be a bad financial move for tinder to get you matches.
On top of all this the app is filled to the brim with catfish and bots. I actually matched someone who was a verified account and tried to scam me. So props to tinder for the verification service. 

So please save your time, effort, and money. You won’t find success from tinder anymore. Those stories a tinder success stories are over. Tinder doesn’t want you to find someone through it anymore. They control everything in the app. There could be dozens of people liking you and it doesn’t even show. This company is corrupt and doesn’t care about the consumer.",Briggsola
Tinder,2020-10-19 19:47:31,"Banned out of nowhere for no reason, customer support won’t even say why",1,"After using tinder for about 6 years, opened the app a few days ago only to find I’d been  banned with zero warnings or any indications of wrongdoing. I always acted respectfully with everyone and didn’t have anything that could possibly be considered controversial on my profile apart from some very tame shirtless pictures and a few anime related memes. 

I messaged tinder support asking what I could’ve possibly done to get banned, especially after having bought 6 months of tinder gold, and I received a copy pasted message telling me I “violated terms of use or community guidelines” without actually telling me what I had done, but then saying I’m still banned and that they apparently don’t have any appeals process whatsoever, so I’m screwed out of my purchase.

My advice, the app is fine but don’t spend a single cent on it, in case this happens to you. Banned suddenly without even a single warning, and no one will even tell you why or hear what you have to say. I lost all my matches and connections and years of effort, and they don’t even have the decency to tell me why or give me a single warning about any “wrongdoing”.",Rick7898
Tinder,2022-07-02 08:16:32,Fake and overpriced,1,"I’ve been on Tinder for 7-8 years by far was the best dating app up until covid started..
Still Keep getting matches from overseas, 99% fake profiles especially in USA for some odd reasons, Whenever I switch my location to any other countries except USA it works like before but here nothing but fake profiles and spams , They make you desperate by not getting matches until you purchase the overpriced BOOST option which still doesn’t get you any match! Downhill big time…I wonder how they can’t control the fake profiles in USA but other countries is fine so weird. Me and all my friends stopped using it or at-least not paying for the useless boost anymore so sad to see Tinder like this and funny thing their verified profiles are all fake lol who monitors this for real?
Also, If a girl doesn’t like you for whatever reason even if you’re the most respectful man but once they report your account that’s said say goodbye to your membership they don’t bother to monitor the complaints they just shut your account down but if you report a girl of course they never close their account cause they need them so you can buy more boost!! sad …",SimonSoccer4ever

I had no direct interactions, offensive materials, solicitations, or external links. Solely my name, age, and pictures- no nudity. Was put under review within 6 hours of download. Banned the next day- and EVERY support person has been robotic in response, pointing to the seriousness of violations BUT not what occurred, my spotless report prior to this mistaken issue, or any sort of response by CS that would indicate that honest paying customers are being heard. Hopefully Tinder reviews reviews better than they review their actual feedback line. Cyd, Chandler, and Shirley all fell well short and with no call support line, all I got was a “How did we do” survey for Shirley at the end (not for Cyd or Chandler). Even my honest and tame response to that was met with Cyd’s “final notice we won’t respond”.

All to a $30 paying customer with over a year flawless track record…. People looking to Tinder should be ware. My experience Tinder took my money for using their tools, banned me, and told me to go to Apple for a disputed refund. What kind of business works like this?",Stick to the Free- No support

I sent Tinder an email explaining the situation giving them screenshots and all I would get back is canned responses. They don’t even look into issues offer you any solutions. I couldn’t sign into my acct from any portal…And never do a six month subscription with this app because if it stops working after the first 60 days nobody will give you a refund.

You’d think that with this high price, the services would at least make sure to show you new people and not cycle past the same hundred people over and over. Now today I got a notification that they’re changing what you get with each upgrade… which shocked me to see that you basically will be getting 5 super likes a week rather than 5 super likes per day… but the price is staying the same. This is just one of the bad changes because none of the alterations are good.

Tinder,2022-11-17 17:23:13,Verification:Tinder employee transphobia -,1,"TLDR:  ti der verification is trnsphobic::

Long version:  Oh wow. Well, i got tinder platinum. Was doing very well, i would say i am “a hit” on the platform.  It keeps asking me for verification, so today i get out of the shower, no makeup, to do it.  The Ai app scans me, and i await a review by an actual person.  I am asked to resubmit new photos and rescan - nope, waste of time, and not necessary or
So i thought.  My platinum tinder is locked up. I cant do anything i paid for.  Obviously the person who reviewed my scan feels me in makeup is not me straight out the shower. I would LOVE to see what they look like.  So as it stands now, as a 46 year old trans person who began her social transiation this year , i need makeup, and my wigs , to present as i am, as did my goth ex girlfriend who is essentially doing the same thing as me as in wearkng a ton of makeup and wigs on top of a 46 year old face.  This is nonsense.  Tinder needs to RETRAIN its verification employees. You asked for TGirls, so you are getting TGirls - but i am a grndmas age now, and if your grandmom wanted to get a new man she would post pics in makeup from a dinner, or a party or an event, not what aue looks like as a 46 year old lady",Eddiethreat
Tinder,2021-07-24 01:23:12,the surveillance mechanism is absolutely useless,1,"As a decent and polite and normal person, my tinder profile is definitely normal but my account gets banned for no reason one day. While on the opposite side, those people profile contain Inappropriate languages or images stays safe. And the tinder group is so arrogant that they don’t even offer a way to correct this!!!!!!!!!!! I had a tinder gold membership and suddenly they told me that I was banned because I violated their terms of use or a community guidelines. This is absolutely ridiculous.
And as far as I know there are lots of people who are in the same situation. 
So tinder if you really cares about your community environment, banning users without even checking manually is definitely not the way out. 
I mean I can understand that sometimes machine will not produce accurate results when it comes to monitoring user behaviors, but offering a formal appeals process is absolutely some of the amendments you can make! 
I try to connect with tinder’s support team, but the answer I get is no difference with the website support. And when I am asking for more help the customer service just gets disappeared.",kevin474758

All appropriate pictures, no hate speech whatsoever, everything was peachy clean yet here I am with a banned account. Of course you can’t call because that would be way too easy so when I reached out to support to AT LEAST see why I got banned they wouldn’t tell me and told me that once you’re banned you’re pretty much banned for life. So here I am banned for no reason at all and can’t even learn what it was that triggered my banning in the first place. I’m all for the safety of others and making sure nobody is offended but how do you expect people to want to use an app and spread good things about it when there is absolutely no communication between owner and operator.

I’m disappointed and frustrated with this outcome due to being an avid user of this app and paying customer for it as well for years. I’ve met some great people off of it and made some great friendships as well from it. It’s just sad that I couldn’t get the help I needed to keep using this app cause I loved it.

If you’re looking for commitment, this is not the app for you. My entire Tinder experience (which has been on and off for YEARS) is absolute trash - the people on here included. Constant gross messages, ghosting, fakes, and just flat out terrible people. But then again, thats every other dating site so it isn't really Tinder’s fault. I just wish they’d allow people to separate based on what they’re looking for. There are hundreds of people in open relationships looking with either another relationship or a threesome.

Then later, months after the matches respond, I finally see their response. I can’t believe how bad, buggy, and frustrating this poorly coded app operates. How many people’s self esteems were damaged because Tinder couldn’t be bothered to pass on the messages that were sent? So many people probably felt ghosted and disrespected not because of anything their counterpart did, but because this company can’t seem to figure out CHAT. Aka INSTANT MESSAGING.

It will say I have 100+ people who swiped on me but will literally get no more than 2-3 matches a week. My messages don’t go through, and matches randomly disappear during a good conversation. It’s extremely frustrating and the app is definitely playing people. Even the secret admirer function tells me to pick one of 4 cards that swiped on me... but when I pick one it says better luck next time. Every single time... there’s so many better apps out there that don’t do this. One starts with a B and another with an H.

Tinder,2022-06-24 06:01:34,"Lower features, higher prices",2,"Tinder is in an odd position as a business: it’s only profitable when it’s not achieving what it claims to achieve. People in happy relationships do not spend $60 a month on “tinder platinum.” The developers have to have just enough features to give you hope,  while trying to keep you single long enough to milk you for all they can. Keep this in mind while using tinder: you are actively fighting against the app itself. 

When tinder first came out, most of its features were free. Unlimited likes, a free super like a day. Now it seems that every time I redownload it, they’re stripped more free features in order to resell them to you at exorbitant prices. Now you get absolutely nothing for free except a handful of regular likes  
 
All in all, as long as you’re aware of the ways the app is scheming to take your money, you can certainly pick a worse dating app. Tinder boasts a large userbase, sleek display, and some fun ways to customize your profile.

Tinder,2023-03-13 18:05:55,You’re better off socializing in person,1,"If tinder was good at finding you matches, it would literally lose its customer base. Tinder is not in the business of match making, in fact quite the opposite, it’s in the business of making you feel desperate enough to spend money on the app. It is designed with planned obsolescence.  

Statistically, men out number women 10 to 1 on tinder. Men average a 0.7% match rate - meaning for every 1000 right swipes, you’ll get 7 matches. That’s a horrendous rate, especially when you consider half of those matches won’t respond, and the other half will be weird/mean/hurt people. You might get 1 good conversation every thousand women you look at. I can easily do better than that going into literally any social environment, this app is terrible. Not to mention it normalizes superficial values and objectification of men and women. Plus it is literally the laziest way possible to approach dating.  Oh is talking to other humans too difficult?

I’ve been using the app on and off for about a year when I’ve been in and out of relationships, and I really enjoyed my experience. I met loads of awesome people on the app and while very few ever turned into anything in person, it was a nice distraction. A couple days ago, I opened the app to discover I was banned. Now, this came as a surprise to me, because I had done nothing wrong to be banned from the app. No explanation was provided in the app, and when I reached out to support, no explanation was provided because they “don’t provide explanations for why bans are issued and don’t offer appeals.” Yikes. This feels very targeted and personally I am very disappointed and disgusted with the way Tinder handles their banning process. At the very least - I deserve to know what rule I supposedly violated that led me to be banned from the app. To provide no explanation at all is just another example of Tinder having absolutely no regard for the safety of its users or caring about its users at all. Sincerely, and I mean GENUINELY disappointed in Tinder. Tinder - do better. You are taking advantage of your users and people are noticing.

Tinder,2022-09-29 21:25:04,Banned Without Context,1,"Well, I am in a foreign country for awhile, and I was hoping to use the app just to meet people here. I had also wanted to reset and have a fresh start on my swipes, and I clearly selected that as the reason when I deleted my old account. However, when I made a new account and even put in the effort to get verified, I got banned two days later. I then took the time to reach out to staff only to get the response that they take their guidelines very seriously, and I would remain banned without even any explanation as to why. I had not interacted with anyone yet, and my profile was very tame compared to others I had seen, so I was incredibly confused and irritated. I understand the importance of safety in social apps like this, but if they Intend to have a permanent ban system, they should at least be willing to provide specific reasoning. There is a fine line between keeping the community safe and just plain being lazy when it comes to customer service, and this app crossed it. It appears I am not the only person this has happened to either — I just feel extra bad for the people who put money into it.",Scynnnamu
Tinder,2022-09-21 17:30:29,Banned for no reason,1,"I have had tinder on and off since I was 18. I have met some wonderful people and current ex boyfriends of mine via tinder. This was a wonderful app to get to know people and see new interesting people out there. But, as time as went on, all men on there just want hookups, when I decline them of sexual favors, they must of report me, always. Because now I’m banned for absolutely no reasoning behind why. I never once talked in a sexual manner to any male on there, if anything that kind of conversation happend on another social media platform. I’ve read so many reviews of people getting banned for no reason. This is absolutely insane and ridiculous how you can just get rid of users left and right without any explanation behind it. All my ex boyfriends are from tinder, I use to use it every day when I was single. Why ban me for something I have not done. Prices on tinder gold and etc, are outrageous. I can’t stand dating apps anymore. Please tinder, if you are going to band 75% of your users, give us reasoning behind why. i’m now 22 and wanting to explore the dating world but yet being banned for no reason has become the issue.",emilynicholson22
Tinder,2021-07-17 17:43:37,Overall pretty decent,1,Overall this app is pretty decent it definitely has more people in match with than others but I was recently banned probably because I had two separate accounts (was unaware this was against TOS) one account was for my business of selling rugs and the other was my personal account. My business account was banned a couple days ago and I was confused as to why until I read the TOS then I made sense and I completely understood why it had happened. But then today I noticed my personal account was banned and it kinda makes sense as well so I tried reaching out to customer service and they stated there is no appeal process for banned accounts which is unfortunate especially as I am a tinder platinum member and paying $30. There should be some sort of appeal process for stuff like this because I never said anything offensive or hurtful to anyone on tinder I just had two accounts which again I was unaware of as most people do not read the TOS or community guidelines. It’s really unfortunate that I am no longer able to use this app anymore over something so insignificant as my case but it is what it is.,ghnhg
Tinder,2023-04-11 18:30:58,Value is no longer here,1,"I just renewed my annual subscription recently. The price is way too high for the value provided now. Previously, Tinder Gold allotted 5 Super Likes a day…now it’s just 5 a week. To buy more super likes is now SIGNIFICANTLY more expensive. I might be able to overlook that by citing current economic turmoil…but here’s the reality: Tinder should be paying ME for the amount of work I do reporting fake and scammer profiles. I’d say a good 85% of all female profiles are fake or scam. They use the same tricks every time and it wouldn’t be hard for Tinder to police this. I have an MBA in Data Analytics and I know the capabilities exist to identify and delete fake/scam profiles…however the platform wants it to seem like they have more users, so they do nothing. Drop the prices, control who uses your platform, and give back the benefits you took away. If you don’t do this, the app will die. There are 100 other dating apps ready to take your market share and you’ve just handed it over on a silver platter. You will never see another dollar from me.

UPDATE: Now about 95% of profiles are fake, scam, or promoting social media. This app is no longer viable.",death2lois
Tinder,2023-01-16 23:19:50,Lack of care for users,1,"Tinder, OkCupid, and Hinge are all part of the Match Group so if you’re banned from one you’re banned from the rest. I woke up one morning to find I was banned on Hinge when I had been pretty inactive there for a month due to the holidays. When I contacted support to appeal, they said the ban originated from another Match Group service. How this is possible I do not know as I had not used OkCupid in over a year and Tinder for several months, with accounts deactivated by myself on both. OkCupid has been wholly unresponsive and Tinder support kept reiterating they will not do anything. Neither will let me know if and how the ban originated from either of them. They claim to take violations “very seriously” but clearly do not reciprocate when a user is concerned that they have been misrepresented with no activity to be held accountable for. I will take this as a blessing in disguise based on my experiences over the years (notice, I went years using these on and off without issue). I do know people who met partners and spouses from off these apps but I was never personally optimistic. Now I’ll never have to worry about it again.",jabrock91
Tinder,2021-01-21 17:44:31,Banned for no reason. No customer service.,1,"I had no problems with Tinder for the amount of time I’ve had it downloaded (which has been about a year, maybe two), until recently. I’ve never done anything inappropriate, never said anything inappropriate, my pictures were not inappropriate. Nothing I’ve done in the last two-ish years has warranted a warning, let alone a ban. However, as soon as I decided to purchase Tinder Gold on January 15th, I was banned from the app about three days later. I did absolutely nothing to get banned, I barely even talked to anyone in that timespan, but the conversations I DID have were just pleasantries and small talk. Nothing warranting a ban. I tried to look for something that would let me contact Tinder, but there was nothing. What kind of app doesn’t offer some sort of customer service for things like this? And the “no appeals” thing makes NO sense. People who do nothing wrong and spend money on this app end up getting banned for no reason, and there’s no way for them to contact someone to try and fix it? No thank you. Add appeals and actual customer service OUTSIDE of the app so you stop stealing money from people!!!",artie ravioli
Tinder,2020-10-10 01:02:50,SO MANY FAKE PROFILES,1,"I’ve been a user for a couple years now, and originally I would have meaningful conversation with multiple matches per week. After some taking time off from the app and finally coming back to it, more than 75% of the profiles I swipe on all have a bio that reads something to the tune of “Wanna see more? Ask for my private Snapchat.”Needless to say if you are unlucky enough to match with one of these people they instantly send you a contact card, unprompted. Currently where I live the amount of 24 year old women named “Kimberly” is astonishing. Clearly some scammer is creating fake profiles and trolling the site to get people to join another site and steal their info. The creators and developers of this application definitely do not have profiles and do not actively use the app. If you are in the market to get scammed, or match up with a chat bot, then this is the perfect app for you. If you are an actual human being looking to match with another actual human being, then definitely do not download this app!! It really is the worst parts of the internet condenses into one location. HUGE WASTE OF TIME AND THANK GOD I NEVER WASTED MONEY FOR THIS TRASH BAG APP MASQUERADING AS A DATING SITE.",ChrisVojkovich
Tinder,2022-10-21 06:07:48,Bans you for life for no reason,1,"Recently opened my account back up and decided to give it another try. Was going well for a couple days, until one day I went to open the app and it said I had been banned. I know for a fact I had not violated any guidelines or offended anyone, as I have not even had a full conversation with others via the app yet. After emailing them asking for assistance and asking what may have happened I was just told I couldn’t get any additional information at this time, and the email itself was scathing to boot. They just keep sending me links to the terms and services/ community guidelines instead of giving any kind of answer or guidance. I feel very mistreated; I would never do anything to make anyone feel upset or angry, and I know I have not done anything. Now I cannot get my account back, nor can I ever make one again in the future. It is making me feel like some sort of criminal when I truly have not done anything. I have had my account for awhile, and have used it off an on, and nothing like this ever happened prior. Just very confused and honestly extremely disappointed",sm0427
Tinder,2021-02-20 18:18:55,Go somewhere else,1,"Tinder seems like a good concept, but after using the app I’ve noticed a lot of fake profiles and or a lot of age discrepancies. I even hung out with a guy who stated he was 22 on the app then come to find out he was actually 19. While tinder seems to go to great lengths to get accurate information and a lot of verifying it’s also kind of annoying I have to give out all that information not knowing if tinder will sell it... I also think there’s an issue with banning. The lacking of an appeals process and relying on user complaints or the algorithm to ban people is pure laziness on the tinder team. People get wrongfully banned or banned without knowing why and it’s ridiculous. There’s a lacking of customer service and usually when you want to complain or contact the company you are just redirected over and over again to already posted information On the site. Then when you do finally submit an issue they’ll send you an email with regurgitated information. Truly this app is a for profit business now constantly pushing for you to upgrade to tinder gold or buy super likes and doesn’t seem to care about anything other than that.",AudieP
Tinder,2020-12-12 06:00:43,They don’t help,1,"I got tinder and was talking to some guys I matched up with when suddenly I got banned, it didn’t even tell me I was banned it just stated that I need to verify my age with my ID which I tried to do, but it wouldn’t even load. I then tried contacting customer service and even sent them a photo of my ID to verify my age, and all I got in response was some crud about how I cannot make an appeal to unban my account, which I didn’t even know was banned at that point. Then when I tried to respond to the email they told me I could not contact them through it so I would have to restart my process all over again, Long story short don’t get tinder and also don’t subscribe to any premium or gold either as I’ve seen in a lot of other comments. I also got tinder gold and used it for about 2 hours before my account was banned so I just lost 15 dollars for no reason essentially. Unless they actually fix my account I will not use tinder and will make sure none of my friends or family ever use it either. This was very disappointing and upsetting, I was very excited to try tinder for the first time and it turns out to be a horrendously managed app.",newtinderuser
Tinder,2022-03-26 23:28:26,Horrible service and….,1,"I see the same profiles over and over on this app. Even after swiping left on them. I tried to contact customer service, however they are Clearly not US based and obviously not able to send any responses that are not scripted. Trying to tell me that these profiles which never change Are people who are constantly deleting and re-creating their profiles. However a couple of these profiles are people I know so I’ve asked them and they said they do not do that. Beyond the horrible customer service and clearly buggy app, There’s no way to limit the distancing with your profile will show up. For example I don’t want people in a different country much less those 100+ miles away to see my profile.  I only want to show up locally. So when I broke down and paid to see the hundred plus people who had swiped right, most of them were 3000 miles away.  I decided it’s time to delete this stupid app. It doesn’t work right, the features to have your profile only show up where you want it to do not exist, and the customer service is horrible.  Don’t waste your money.",ScottinStep
Tinder,2022-08-23 12:56:02,Trans women DONT WASTE YOUR TIME,1,"Tinder is absolutely ridiculous when it comes to the way it treats trans women. I have now been banned three times for no reason at all. It was forgiven the first time because I assume someone noticed I didn’t do anything. But they have never given me any reason as to why i’ve been banned and when I try to reach out to customer service by submitting a request they slap a fake name on the email and send me the exact same copy and paste message that says “you’ve been banned…” yes but why? i use multiple other dating sites such as bumble, hinge, and taimi yet i have NEVER been banned from tbere and I do the same thing. 

THE PROBLEM IS: straight men are upset that a trans woman comes up on their profiles to swipe. they report me so it blocks me from coming up again and after enough do that i’m banned for no reason. i do not post inappropriate pictures, i don’t participate in illegal activity, i don’t even treat the men who harass me about being trans that bad. i can’t go out and meet people at bars because it’s literally unsafe and now i’m banned from one of the only ways i can meet people. DO BETTER TINDER DONT BE TRANSPHOBIC",dave6665
Tinder,2022-06-18 09:28:04,Tinder Conspiracy Theory,1,"I seriously have no clue what I was banned for. There was no reason for me to have been kicked off this app. It’s absurd. A system that will remove you without any reason being given and no appeals process….it’s immoral. NO SYSTEM should be run that way. Can we start a conspiracy theory for what the basis is for these out of nowhere bans? Is there a common thread line for everyone that has been unjustly and arbitrarily removed? I’m a conservative, is that it? Do the leftist freaks who monitor private conversations at Tinder get their rocks off by banning people who think differently? Just a thought. Anyway, outside of my conspiracy theory, I’ve heard that you can be banned for just getting reported three times over the entire course of use. Well, I’ve had a couple of heated political discussions and my guess is that some fragile women reported me because they didn’t like my opinions. My journey may be done with Tinder but I get the last jab in….here is your one star Tinder; you deserve it. 
PS: I found the girl of my dreams right before I was banned. So, Tinder actually can help you find someone special if that’s actually what you want.",xXWindowlickerXx
Tinder,2021-04-18 14:58:42,Worst dating / hookup app,1,"The frequency and quality of my matches are abysmal. I’ve had decent success with other apps so I’m pretty convinced at this point that my issue is not my profile but rather tinder itself. On bumble I usually have half a dozen or more matches every day, whereas with tinder I get maybe (?) one a day? I think I probably swipe left on 75% or more of the people that pop in to my feed which indicates to me the algorithm is terrible at determining my type or it’s just deliberately flooding my feed with low quality profiles to get me to pay for premium. Which I refuse to do bc the free version is terrible. 

In addition to the low quality of profiles, I also set my preferences to strictly 10 miles or closer. This shouldn’t be an issue because I live in one of the largest cities in the country. Yet somehow I continue to see people who are dozens of miles away. And also international people?? Why would I want to see them on my feed?? 

Awful service, will likely delete my profile soon. Had the free version been better I would’ve paid for premium (which I do with hinge bc it’s a high quality service).",city kid 172772
Tinder,2022-11-17 19:06:47,Tinder what’s the problem?,1,It’s been having a lot of issues lately. I’ve had to contact support multiple times to fix issues . This last time I emailed them they claimed they couldn’t help me fix the bug because I wasn’t using the email I signed up with when it was I send a pic proving it was they send a email response saying they will delete my profile for me. I DIDN’T ASK YOU TO DO THAT!!!! I had to re make another profile !!!!! I then use tinder for what it’s intended for ya know SWIPING to meet people and because I swipe on “to many people “ I’m not real and i need my profile locked so they can verify me didn’t even have the new profile for more then 8 hours ……there is plenty of men on there who don’t need to be verified and we all know men harass women and have sus behavior all the time but that’s okay right ? They can make sexual comments about my body and harass me when I don’t respond but they can have profiles and don’t need to be locked out 27/7 . I don’t do anything wrong on tinder that makes me have “suspicious behavior “ And they constantly are locking me out and making me verify who I am. Kind of over it .,hehhsushebvwveh
Tinder,2020-08-28 05:08:41,Trouble Unsubscribing,3,"Why is it near impossible to unsubscribe? I logged into Tinder on the their website, clicked on settings and clicked “Manage Payment Account”.
Then it shows a message saying I subscribed on the native app and that I should unsubscribe from there. No problem. I get on the app and go to my settings and guess what? THERE IS NO “Manage Payment Account” in the settings tab! So I try unsubscribing via Apple ID (iTunes), even though I paid directly with CC. Nothing was found under subscriptions either. Okay. I try to look for a link to customer support and there is literally no way to contact support unless you call them. Are you serious? Make it easier to unsubscribe for the sake of everything fair! I’m still stuck trying to figure out how the hell to unsubscribe before I get charged on my card again. It’s ridiculous how the developers remove the payment option on the app. 

In all fairness, the app is decent and you can find people to meet if you really put the effort into it. Just be careful when subscribing.",DanFingerMan
Tinder,2020-10-09 13:37:19,There’s always been bugs,3,"Tinder’s goal is to help you meet people, and it does that well, but getting there can be a struggle with all these bugs. The app constantly breaks when I swipe from a profile too the messages tab, things get hung up, even on a newer iPhone. Sometimes the app crashes. My biggest pet peeve is the fact that unless I turn on every form of notification for Tinder, I have a notice inside every conversation telling me to turn on notifications. I get a lot of notifications from Tinder, so I would like to have them sent to Notification Center without a banner, badge, or sound. The app constantly is reminding me to “turn notifications on!” even when they ARE on, just sent to the Notification Center. When I DO get notifications in my Notification Center, they never stack, so tinder notifications take up my whole screen. SOOO annoying. I like this app and I know it can be better, that’s why I’m being critical. Great work, but I hate the fact that my favorite dating app can be so frustrating.",adam_and
Tinder,2022-05-15 11:44:20,Banned without reason,1,"I’ve had tinder for a few years now. I’d go through periods of use and nonuse every few months. I’m a college student and sometimes it’s just an easy way to meet people. Was going through some down time when I opened up the app to find I had been band. No reason given even when I contacted tinder support. I’m not a very social person. Most of the time I never contacted matches and would just delete them. The response from tinder was that I had violated community guidelines. They gave no further info and refused to have an appeal process. If you can’t have an appeal process then you shouldn’t have a social media app. Seriously, use some logic. If I’m never really on the app and rarely change anything then why would I be banned? I guess we’ll never know. Don’t waste your time with this app.

UPDATE: tinder still refuses to give reason and has now violated their own terms of service in the entire process. It’s all automated so their “customer service” is non existent. They still don’t have an appeal process and refuse to revise their system. Just thought I’d let you all know.",AngryIFunnyer
Tinder,2022-04-08 21:25:35,Tinder favors transphobes,1,"I am a trans woman in a not so accepting state so meeting people who would be secure enough in their masculinity to be with a trans woman outside of the apps can be challenging, that’s why I loved tinder; it was a way for me to convey the fact that I am trans in a way that wouldn’t put my well being at risk and allowed me to connect with guys who weren’t intimidated or ashamed to be with me I met all of my partners on tinder, that’s not to say I didn’t experience incredible transphobia and homophobia, so imagine my shock when I was banned from tinder with no rhyme or reason so I quickly contact tinder’s customer service email and sent this “I’ve run into a lot of transphobia on the app and am disturbed to see that tinder would take the side of my oppressors I’m simply looking to find a partner and that is hard to find in the real world being trans” and they simply replied with we don’t do ban appeals. I know it sounds dumb but this situation has thrown me back into the depression cycle that I was in pre-transition I simply want love and I think that I’m deserving of it and have given a good amount of money to tinder to achieve my goal.",shaula02
Tinder,2021-05-06 02:22:13,TINDER DOESNT CARE ABOUT WOMEN 🤷🏾‍♀️🤣,1,"I haven’t logged into my account or been active for a couple of days now and haven’t held a conversation with anyone in those couple of days, most of my matches haven’t responded back to me. So I’m not 100% sure as to why my account has been banned. Me not responding back to my matches is not my fault and shouldn’t be a reason that my account gets banned. My bio is safe and my pictures and boomerangs are all safe. I’ve had the same tinder profile for over three years now and have NEVER violated any of the terms and conditions. My account is even verified. So if I do not get my profile back I will just get my money refunded because obviously tinder will just ban an account without hearing the other person’s side. I’ve had many men on this website be rude and vulgar and yet the only thing that I do unmatch with them. Why do men get to just make a decision if a woman gets banned from a dating app or not. I would also LOVE to know what terms and conditions I violated! Also you do not talk with a real person, you talk to a robot that responds back to you when you send in your emails.",_diamondheartb_
Tinder,2023-01-10 05:35:19,Models aren’t always fake and this app is misogynistic,1,"If you’re a model, you can forget it. This app isn’t for you. You’ll be banned if people think you’re “too good to be true”. I was banned a while ago, I made a new account a few weeks ago, and it was just banned too. This is so ridiculous! It’s not as if there were any cute girls that wanted to talk to me anyway. Dating apps in general are a joke compared to meeting people in person, but Tinder takes the cake for the very worst right after MeetMe. I guess I’m either too pretty for dating apps, or Tinder (an app for adults I thought? And I was not explicit by any means!) hasn’t been clear enough on what isn’t allowed in bios. Regardless, Tinder lost someone that the vast majority of people would swipe right on, and I lost access to an app that did nothing positive for me, and left MUCH to be desired. I guess I should go to clubs where they only let in women that are too good looking to be real so I can fit in and not be seen as fake, and meet girls as cute as me. But this app was NO GOOD. I met one cool guy on there back in 2016 but it wasn’t worth the time and effort in the end.",AbiVGoolz
Tinder,2022-07-13 03:58:33,Terrible customer service,1,I had an account since 2015 used the app in and out between the years during relationships. In 2022 saw they had an option for profile verification. Regardless of me having all credentials to prove it’s me while also not messaging or actively using the app I decided after a month of being Mia I wanted to match with someone but decided to get that blue check mark they provide. I did what the app said and 45 minutes later I was banned for no reason. As I request an appeal an automated message has popped up to tell me it’s permanent and I went against the terms and conditions. I decided to message back again to ask to verify what I did which led to another automated message saying they cannot give details on what I did. If I wasn’t active for a month and the first thing I did was try to get that blue check mark and my account wasn’t under review WOULDNT there be some type of explanation tinder customer service could provide. Regardless if the account won’t be unbanned give the exact reasoning for it since the ban links to your social accounts and phone number anyways.,XKyoskeX
Tinder,2022-02-08 04:26:45,Trash fire of an app,1,"All about the money. Overpriced. Can’t see who’s swiped you unless you pay (overpriced). Won’t be able to be seen by those you’ve swiped unless you pay (overpriced). Gotta swipe for years and years just to see someone you may be compatible with—and if you accidentally swipe left and want to go back, once again, you’ve got to pay (and yes you guessed it, it’s overpriced !) Even if there’s tons of people who’s swiped you, you’ll only see tons of people who haven’t just~ to waste your time and keep you on the app. They even added some stupid, completely irrelevant interactive game with beautiful actors portraying your “friends” so you can feel less like loser, I’m guessing? (It’s an ironic game) It’s gorgeously shot but instead of using all of your money to make a better app, they spend it on stupid things like that to keep you on the app and not deliver on what they claim to be in business for: dates.

Tinder,2022-01-10 01:32:09,So much room for improvement,2,"TL;DR unsupportive support

Like many others, I had gotten banned briefly with no notification. I paid for a 1 year gold membership, so some courtesy was expected, silly me. When I reached out to support, I received a canned response, and then a response from a person who said that the email address I was writing from wasn't associated with an account, so they couldn't help me. The email address that I 1) used to sign up 2) used to verify my account 3) have listed on the app and 4) which it automatically used/linked when contacting support. After probably 24 hours, my account was back up and only one profile was missing. I assume that guy reported me for...not responding to ""hey"" when I was at work? We'll never know because their support is unsupportive. 

Also, I have all notifications turned off except ""new messages."" At least twice daily, I get a ""peak swipe time"" notification. Really gotdamn annoying to have to open the app to clear out the notification from the icon twice a day. Will not be renewing.",username-is-taken
Tinder,2020-09-15 12:36:06,It’s alright,3,"Given the benefit of the doubt the app does seemingly have a lot of issues but overall it’s not the WORST experience possible. I think one of the biggest issues is the various prices for Tinder gold. Now they want to charge me $45/mo (I’m 19) whereas they want to charge my friend (keep in mind who is also 19) $15/mo. I’m not too sure what’s with the price discrepancy but I’m sure I’m not the only one who’s experienced this. $15 seems reasonable but $45 a month? Definitely won’t be happening. As for the user base, you find a LOT of bots but thats to be expected you can find a numerous amount of bots on seemingly any “dating app” that’s just how it is. So I won’t mark off too many points for that but another issue is the lack of finding people who like you. I could swipe right on everyone like a mad man (which I don’t WANT TO DO) and still not find a single person who liked me (which it’s not like I have 0 likes I have a good bit) I know this is probably a ploy for me to get the tinder gold but then we go back to the $45/mo issue.",Joshua Helm
Tinder,2020-11-01 19:33:39,Banned when they didn’t help me appropriately,2,When I contacted tinder intially in regards to being unable to access my account due to me getting a new phone number. Everytime I went through the reset steps it returned back to me having to access my phone number I previously had. Remind you this has happened before where I had my number changed and they were able to resolve my problem before. This time after telling me to use the other step instead of verifying through my number which I did. Which failed because it still circulated me back to the step of verifying through my old number. Tinder support then send me a email that I’m banned! This is upsetting after tinder support failed me twice in assisting me with this matter. This is legit reason they can be sued for. In regards to being banned and then violating their own terms and agreement. After giving me the wrong solution to my initial problem. All that was mention was that I violated terms and agreement. I read it all and I have not violated anything after using tinder in and out over the years.,none Ya17
Tinder,2022-10-12 17:22:06,Purposefully hiding profiles that have liked you,1,"I have had 30 profile likes, of course from people within my area, for over a week now. I’ve used my daily likes every day and now it tells me that “there are no more profiles in my area” for me to go through. In that entire week that number of likes only went down by one, so through that entire week and hundreds of profiles it purposefully chose it only show one of them that liked me, and now it wants to claim it has shown me everything when clearly it is hiding behind its back from me those 30 profiles which have liked me. Furthermore it knows that I know this given that it is showing me these likes, so they are putting them in a hostage situation, holding my romantic opportunity at ransom of paying their premium price just for me to achieve the purpose the app claims you can achieve without paying. Clearly however it is impossible to find matches now on free, and thus this app is useless and I urge for the app makers to change they’re greedy cruel model or continue to be berated by one star reviews.

Tinder,2022-01-09 02:20:50,Makes an incel out of all of us.,1,"It’s more of the users that cause it than it is the platform. Swiping is just too easy, and no one does it selectively. If you’re a guy, better be over at least an 8 or you’ll be ghosted by all your matches (that means even if they swipe right on you, they’re still not actually interested). If you’re a girl, you’ll be overwhelmed with such a massive selection of easy men you’ll get lazy. Then there’s the pseudo-philosophy on Super Likes and greetings. What should be a great way to get someone you’re really interested in to know, they’ve been branded as “creepy” or “thirsty”. And intros. The fundamental basics of conversation are greetings, but those aren’t welcome here. People demand something mind blowing right off the bat, and they’re still unlikely to respond. And finally, maybe the worst thing is, Tinder will actively select who’s most attractive and show them first. If you’re anything less than gorgeous, you won’t be seen. The only way to bypass this is if you pay for the Platinum service. It’s a shame because it’d work wonders if people were a little more thoughtful.",A1R1A
Tinder,2020-11-20 03:55:21,Banned For No Reason,1,"You would think a corporation as large as Tinder would have their stuff together. But quite the opposite. Tinder focuses on methods like tinder gold jut as a cash grab. And with millions of users, Tinder is by far the most popular dating app, and they use it to their advantage. 

Address the unnecessary banning. I had been us in tinder for over five years till, for no reason, I was banned for nothing. Still, you can read all the 1-star reviews about the bans. It's ridiculous. You would assume tinder would do something to fix it or even address some people, but they don't, and that is the most annoying thing. I travel a lot and have met some fantastic people on Tinder, and for them to ban me well, it's annoying cause you can't even appeal your case. 

Here my two cents for your tinder. If it were just one person posting about the ban on the issue, I would understand. But the fact that many users are getting banned should be a concern of yours. I know you won't address me, but I will continuously rate you 1-star for your terrible customer service and lack of explaining.",557ve
Tinder,2022-07-15 18:39:35,"Used to be the best dating app, now its all Fake profiles",1,"Tinder used to be the best dating app for meeting people online, Now its just flooded with fake profiles, bots, scammers, and women just trying to sell you their Onlyfans. It feels like there are no authentic profiles anymore. The few that there are Tinder pushes back on the algorithm so you are forced to pay for their premium services which have also gone up in price significantly and offer much less features. With the basic Gold profile you used to be able to see who swiped right on you and would get 5 super likes a day. Now neither of those features are included and instead are part of much more expensive packages. The once a month boost you would get is also gone. All of this to say that Tinder is dead for the regular users who actually liked the app for being able to connect and interact with people looking for the same thing as you. Its gone and probably never coming back. Other dating apps like Bumble and even Hinge are now much better for dating and meeting people. Say good bye to Tinder it was fun while it lasted",Jorgillo_
Tinder,2021-08-24 23:18:41,Disappointing,1,"I bought the platinum subscription when I signed up for the app a few days ago. Things went smoothly at first, then I noticed that my matches stopped messaging me and I wasn’t getting anymore likes. I didn’t think much of it at first, then I got a Snapchat message from someone I matched with asking me if I unmatched her. She said that she couldn’t see our Tinder messages or my profile anymore. At this point, I decided to ask someone else I matched with if they could see my Tinder profile, and they couldn’t. I messaged a Tinder rep and they said everything was fine on their in, then miraculously my matches could see my profile again (though I still haven’t gotten any new likes). My guess is that I got “shadow banned.” Apparently, Tinder can ban your profile and you won’t even know. The app is still functionally the same for you and it even looks like you can send messages, but you’re invisible to everyone else. So you can line their pockets by buying all the subscriptions and boosters you want while your profile isn’t even being shown to others.",dreadapollo
Tinder,2021-07-11 16:41:19,The Biggest Scam,1,Tinder is by far the most successful scam app in the App Store without a doubt so let me explain and break it down for you. Everyone you know has had a tinder at one point which means there will be conversations that get started which could lead to disagreements which would end up with your account being banned with no warning or shadowbanned with no warning. I’m not even going to discuss the ban issue because there is more than enough reviews on that so let’s discuss the shadowban. If you’ve ever wondered why you used to get a lot of likes but no longer receive any ? Shadowban! If you ever wondered why you send a lot of messages but never get any replies? Shadowban! Basically anything you do will get you shadowbanned or actually banned but the craziest part is they will never give you a warning or inform you and they will continue to give you a couple likes every blue moon so you will continue to pay for boost/tinder gold… At this point they are running a successful multi million dollar scam empire that will end with them getting sued and I am seriously considering taking legal action,James Ramirez IV
Tinder,2021-04-28 01:15:17,Banned without reason,1,"I was banned suddenly for absolutely no reason. My photos were appropriate, guys I spoke to told me they’d seen lots of overt boobage and advertising for OF on most of the girl’s accounts and I had none of that. One day without warning I received a banned notification. No warning, no suspension, just all the sudden banned. I reached out in the only available manner and received an email response saying they wouldn’t help me at all, just simply they don’t tolerate violating their terms, which I appreciate but I never did any of that (I even read it in depth to see if I may have violated something strange you’d never expect). They offered no direction or explain action on what might’ve happened. I even filed a complaint on the way they handled the matter. I had a paid account for 6 months as I’m a traveler and wanted to be able to change my location and meet people in different places (travel mode) and had 5 months left... I asked for refund but of course they didn’t even acknowledge that request. There is no way to call or dispute anything. TINDER IS AN ABSOLUTE SCAM, BEWARE! 🙄",Hola Olalala
Tinder,2022-10-03 07:43:51,Wouldn’t recommend,2,"The amount of 1 and 2 star reviews on here for the most part seem to be saying the same thing: bugs, scams, and ban issues and I’d say they’re accurate I bought tinder to try it and I’m not impressed I would lose matches that I was having good conversation with out of nowhere with no way to contact them anymore the app would show me people way out of my distance zone I would use the monthly boosts and do swipe surges only to get like 1 match on top of that the app is riddled with bots and scam accounts there seems to be an issue with the gender preference and worst of all you can’t even use the app without paying as a dude this app will likely only hurt your self esteem and as a female you’re likely going to get spammed and have to constantly dodge shady accounts if you want a date my best advice is to go somewhere and meet people because these dating apps aren’t worth your time and they’re certainly not worth your money until they fix the issues and I see other better reviews I won’t pay again.",_CM44_
Tinder,2020-10-06 11:01:03,Worst company ever go to hinge,1,This company allows people to ban you for no reason. I was banned within one hour of opening my profile to women.  When I had the same profile for 2 months prior with just men.  No nudity no harassment and when I asked for an investigation they told me though they say the offer investigations they won’t be doing them.  They allow men to put down they just want their privates sucked.  They allow people to put down they are drug dealers.  But I got banned for no reason and they won’t even tell me why they just keep saying I violated the rules but not what rule or anything cause they do it without evidence.  Plus they keep the page up I am still getting guys hitting me up asking to take me to the beach.  Please remove the profiles you block I don’t need men hitting me up cause my ig was attached still. Why say you investigate when your lazy company refused to.  To bad I couldn’t give ZERO stars cause what you did was a violation of my rights as I did nothing wrong.  Wow what a disgusting place we live in that we are quarantined yet places you can go to find people to chat with ban and you but leave your profile in limbo,chickwithattitude
Tinder,2021-05-08 15:35:29,It’s tinder,3,What up bros so I tell you what whenever I download tinder I didn’t have any beliefs of finding someone attractive and till this day I still don’t. Put it like this I’m not a unattractive sack of meat. I’m much above the average Justin so after about a year or 5 of using it I decided screw it since the cost has gone down dramatically for unlimited swipes I might as well pay $15 for 6 months. Now once I did this it completely opened up a whole mother category’s of girls. All of a sudden I was matching with girls that are 5k-8k miles away and it’s my understanding that I need to get on a boat just to reach them. Now I was allowed to swipe as many times as I would like so I did take advantage of that to its fullest. Put it like this would I pay again? Depends on how thirsty I am and if there is another pandemic that makes all girls scared to talk to people. But since the girls at the gym don’t appreciate the conversations he’ll yeah I would unless the price becomes like bumble then he’ll no,Ohthatsnate100
Tinder,2022-05-30 02:46:57,I have been scammed!,1,"I purchased a Tinder Platinum membership early this month during which I did not get any “likes” and that the same folks appeared to my screen for me to like or dislike their profiles over and over again. Then, I decided to cancel my subscription two weeks ago knowing that it will still be good until October 30, 2022 (I paid $110 Platinum good for 6 months). Yesterday, I tried to use the Tinder app only to find out that I have to create a new profile, which I did. Now my Platinum subscription is invalid. Also, all of a sudden I have “likes,” but of course I have to purchase Gold or Tinder plus or Platinum to view profiles of those who “liked” mine. I contacted Tinder and they told me to restore my purchase for me to view the profiles. Why do I have to restore my purchase when I have an active (Platinum) subscription which is good until October? Could someone tell me if this not a scam, which I totally believe it is!? I won’t be surprised if Tinder will be a subject of another Class Action like what happened in 12/21 because of its malpractice scamming people out of their money!",Mabistaka
Tinder,2022-01-03 20:49:46,Banned for no reason,1,Normally I wouldn’t care if I care if I was banned from something it’s very rare that I am. I’ve notice I’m also not the only review about being banned. To start I have not been on tinder in years due to me being in a relationship. I got a new phone and number and decided to give it another try. After I had downloaded the app I went to try and create an account and it said I was banned. I’ve tried reaching out to the joke you call customer service multiple times which is just an automated email response and no one will contact me over the phone so I can see how this even happened to me. I still don’t have any answers no one will respond to me and I’m honestly disappointed and dissatisfied with this app now. If this is really how y’all are going to treat your customers then I hope others read these reviews before considering downloading this app. Like I said if I already had the account and I did something to get myself banned I would understand but I hadn’t even made an account with my current number yet and it’s already telling me I’m banned.,SunnyW05
Tinder,2020-10-07 02:12:36,"Scam, Needs to be Removed from Store & Editors Choice",1,"Complete scam. I’ve been using the app on and off for 3 years and have. not. once. matched with a real person. It tells you you have multiple likes just to get you to spend money on gold, because it will never actually show you these accounts. I paid for gold for about 2 months last year and it was revealed that every account that had liked me was a bot account 1000+ miles away, and then I never got anymore likes after paying for the subscription. Used boosts, changed discovery settings, uploaded different pictures, changed bio, nothing. On top of that, it then banned me for no reason and customer service is non existent. 
I recently decided to give the app another try, a friend let me use their phone number to sign up, and it is the same exact thing. For 5-6 days it has been telling me I have 18 likes but no amount of swiping has given me a match or decreased the number of likes. It also starts to freeze and crashes if you swipe left more than 5 times in a row. Tinder only exists to get your hopes up and steal your money. Garbage, scam app.",mr greasy
Tinder,2023-03-16 01:36:47,Get ready to be banned for no reason,1,"I wouldn’t recommend even downloading Tinder, because you will more than likely get banned for breathing the wrong way. I went to open my app one day and saw I was banned - with no explanation, just referring to the Terms of Service. Good luck trying to get in contact with support. Their support is almost non-existent. They will never respond to emails and their phone number isn’t even in operation. They will wait until you make a purchase for Tinder Gold or any other overpriced subscription, and will ban you with no refunds allowed. If I could give this app zero stars I would. The app is overpopulated with fake profiles, robots, and scammers who seem to never get banned. But don’t worry, Tinder will make sure to ban the good people for absolutely nothing. I cannot tell you the amount of times I have seen a profile with a fully naked person in it, report it, and continue to see the same profile across the app weeks later. This app is absolutely a scam. I will be filing a report to the BBB for the denial of service I received after making a purchase.",ddagostino1
Tinder,2022-12-23 15:50:56,Banned for no reason??,1,"I’ve been a tinder user for awhile now. It’s going on about 2ish years? I tend to delete and recreate my tinder at least once or twice a year because I get sick of the dating scene and want a break. I’ve never had any issues with it until just now. I recreated my tinder and did the photo verification thing. I go back to my account awhile later to find that I’ve been permanently banned because I “violated terms of service”. What did I even violate though when the only way to get banned is 1.) harass people (which PLENTY of men I’ve matched with have technically done yet they still have an account), 2.) post nudity (never done that), and/or 3.) have multiple accounts to get more matches, which I’ve permanently deleted my accounts every time before recreating a new one. There’s also no email to contact for support to see if you can get the ban appealed. I don’t know if the reason was the fact I deleted and recreated my tinder account too many times? Which either way, that’s the whole point of being single is taking breaks or going through trial and error.",des.77777777
Tinder,2022-12-03 11:33:15,Tinder is just a money grab,1,"It's dumb that you have to PAY to see who likes you. I'm using Tinder to potentially find my soulmate, not waste my money and thinking women will talk to me even after paying. I'm about to delete the app just because over 98% of the women who do match with me, end up not replying to my messages or they unmatch from me before I can even see who they are or talk to them. I don't really view myself as an ""ugly"" person but I will agree I'm definitely not the most attractive person either. I'm a pretty decent looking guy who's got a house, a car, a job, bills are paid, my life is pretty much together, yet nothing seems to satisfy women on this God forsaken app. To the employees at Tinder, please fix your app to satisfy everyone's needs and stop making your app seem like it's definitely going to help people find the love of their life. Your app is nothing but a false sense of hope for single people who don't have that good of luck of potentially finding their soulmate. At least on Grindr you can actually see who taps you and you can talk to them without paying for anything.",SwiftlyMatty
Tinder,2022-07-14 18:51:28,Not worth it,2,"After having dated online for many years I finally gave tinder a try. The interface is decent and its easy to use. It hookup roots are showing in the lack of filtering basics like parenthood, height, and whatnot. But my biggest gripe is that after two weeks on tinder plus having used 50 super likes and having literally run out of profiles within 15 miles of a major urban area i have a grand total of two matches and two other women who swiped right. I’m a decent looking guy with a well crafted profile. The same profile on bumble gets loads of matches. So i have to conclude that tinder is just not showing it to anyone. Its not worth any more of my money and time.

One more thing: they need a way to optionally not see profiles of people who live in other places but are just in town temporarily. If you’re looking for a hu then it makes sense to see visiting non-locals. But if you’re looking for something lasting then you may not want to waste time swiping on profiles from all over the world. It should be an option.",Clark Battle
Tinder,2021-10-24 22:26:27,Banned for no Reason - Awful Customer Service.,1,"I downloaded this app yesterday. I was using it for maybe 45 minutes and I had already gotten 99+ likes. I didn’t swipe right on many people so I only ended up matching with a few people. I was talking to a few people last night and was enjoying my time. I wasn’t showing any skin in any of my pictures, they weren’t inappropriate at all. My conversations weren’t inappropriate either as I wasn’t looking for hookups, but mostly friends.
I woke up this morning to see that my account was banned. I did absolutely nothing to make this happen so I am extremely frustrated. I emailed support and they gave me a robotic answer saying they take people going against the community guidelines and terms and conditions very seriously, however I did nothing to violate any of them. They did absolutely nothing to help me. The team behind Tinder is a bunch of Robots, because anybody looking into my ban report would know it was wrongfully done. I’m very annoyed.

Out of nowhere I amrandomly banded because some fake users wrongfully reported me. My messages are clean I know they are. I am verified. Im completely legit. Please tinder this has to be a glitch i literally just purchased tinder platinum. I had almost 80plus matches so much time wasted. So how am I supposed to make a tinder again if can’t use my number and I do not have a Facebook..... I guess I could use Instagram. But this is ridiculous.

Tinder,2021-05-03 22:06:34,Banned for no reason,1,"I was getting matched with accounts that were 9000 miles away and outside of my age parameter so I started to report them. And then I found that I was reporting 10 accounts a day and not even getting a single match. So I reached out to customer service to let them know that there was something wrong that the age in the distance were incorrect and they told me that they were offering a free passport to users in the month of April and that’s why they were matching me two accounts that were 9000 miles away. I told him that I had global turned off and I didn’t want any matches outside of my parameters they gave me some ideas reinstall the app etc. that didn’t work so I reached out to them a second time then this morning I woke up to being banned.

5/3/21: multiple attempts to customer service to find out why I was banned and they keep telling me they can’t provide me detailed info just that I’ve violated either community guidelines or TOS.

Tinder,2021-04-25 03:29:26,Scamming you,1,"There has been so many issues on this app in the past year! First off, they hardly ever show your profile anymore to anyone and you will hardly get matches. Then they recommend you buy extra deals which are just a way to get you back to how tinder used to be. I used to get 300+ likes with around a 100 matches within a couple months and I tried it a month ago and I got 85 (combined matches and likes) in that time span. Not only this, but recently they will delay your matches for some reason. I had swiped on this dude a couple days ago and he added me on snap the same day (we never matched though). Then all of a sudden, tonight it shows we just matched a couple minutes ago. I do not know why it was delayed by a couple days, but this has definitely not been the first time it’s happened. I used to not mind tinder but recently I just see them as a company that sees you being hopeful as a way to make money off you. They will legit not show your profile and when you get feel alone, they recommend you pay $15-20 to actually be seen.",Kacilyisa

The worst part is you’re not told of this profile status and they WILL let you pay for gold which does nothing other than take your money. They’re making their money off of guys hoping for a connection. They track and store your pictures, when they recognize them you’re immediately shadow banned, if you try to make a new profile and previous was banned they’ll ban it, they track your specific phone serial numbers and ID’s, your IP address, if you were ever banned if their system recognizes any of above mentioned you’ll get banned again. Your only chance is a new device, phone number, IP address, emails, new pictures, and don’t be ugly anymore. Then pray you don’t make any of the many easy mistakes to not get shadow banned again.

Tinder,2020-10-09 15:04:47,Terrible service,1,"I have been using Tinder off and on for a few years now, and have never had any issue aside from the app being super dead most of the time. Recently my account was banned with no warning or explanation, and the customer service is awful. I have never violated any of Tinder’s policies or terms of use, have always had a very respectful bio and clean conversations, and do not share a profile with anyone. I state in my bio that I would like a boyfriend, that I am polyamorous, trans, and married. I do not have anything rude or degrading and it’s disgusting seeing all of the other people who had been banned for no reason just the past few days. 
Tinder does not have a way to appeal the decision that they make to terminate accounts, and will not offer any explanation as to why they have done so aside from saying “sorry, you can’t come back”. It is obviously a big enough issue that they have a section to contact customer service about it, so I find it ridiculous that they don’t have any way to have someone review it.

Like so many others who’ve had this issue, nothing about my account violated or even came close to violating their policies. My pics were safe and clean, and none of my conversations were explicit or vulgar at all. I explained that my account was suddenly banned out of nowhere and I just wanted to know why exactly it was. When I got a response, they gave me a generic reply saying that unfortunately there’s nothing they can do about it. The ban is permanent. I got zero explanation for why I was banned and the message I got from them was clearly copied and pasted. Also (for those of you that don’t know) when Tinder bans you, you’re very likely to be banned from other dating apps as well.

I then went and read through all the guidelines, none have been broken or even close to being broken. I then emailed them, since the phone number they provide is a non existent number, and I got a reply that said they do not do appeals at this time but wouldn’t tell me what guideline I had broken. I have emailed 5 times since and have been given the same email response all five times. I was so pleased with the app until this incident. I have since canceled my subscription(and if you payed for the yearly plan and your account gets banned you get no refund), my friends have already canceled theirs and deleted their accounts.

Tinder,2022-11-11 10:21:28,Unbelievable,1,"If I could give a negative review, I would. The customer support team is an absolute joke. I was banned for absolutely no reason. I had just gotten my account back because of a bug where I couldn’t access it for months. I redownloaded the app two days ago, was on the app for, at most 5 minutes, before getting the message that I’ve been banned. I reached out to customer support and got a robot like response that was the most unhelpful response you could get. When I asked for the reasoning behind being banned, they said they couldn’t provide any more information, which is hilarious to me because they haven’t provided ANY information at all. This app is a complete joke. They need to change their ‘policy’ to where they provide actual information to someone when they’re banned. There’s a lot of other reviews on here from people having the same situation as me, which is ridiculous and should be an eye opener for the app developer to change some things and provide better customer support instead of hiring actual robots to run the department.",@BDLJJjanos
Tinder,2022-03-30 03:55:08,Poor service all around,1,"Within 30 hours of having this app, my account was put under review and then banned. In the midst of this all, I had only been able to swipe left and right on other profiles due to the fact that there was a constant error message stating “failed to match with …” that I couldn’t solve. I contacted customer service and all O received back was a “thank you for notifying us, we will get back to you shortly.” A short 12 hours and a payment for a gold subscription, I was banned. The reason? Violating guidelines. 

To clarify, my profile had not violated any of the community guidelines, nor had any messages since I was unable to send one the entire time having the app. When I asked customer service again for removal of the unearned ban, all I could receive was a “we can not provide more details at this time. Your account is permanently banned due to violating community guidelines.”

Tinder,2022-07-16 15:00:57,Oh how the mighty have fallen,1,"This used to be a (mostly) GREAT app. I used it pretty often on and off the past couple years and decided to download it again because why not. I saw that prices had SIGNIFICANTLY been raised and also the app for whatever reason seems to hide people and say there’s no more people left to swipe on, even though i live in a city with a population of 3 million (like seriously, i doubt there’s <100 users in the city of houston, tx. especially with my prior experience w this app.) but even then i shrugged it off and even purchased Tinder Platinum (which is currently $30 a month) and continued using the app. To my surprise, after a WEEK of using the app like a totally normal person and not having a single bad interaction with anyone my account was banned?? Then i contact support and they can’t even tell me what terms i violated?? I’m definitely getting a refund and on top of that telling everyone i know that considers tinder in the future about this.

Tinder,2021-11-27 19:34:35,Tinder needs to clean up,1,"I’ve used Tinder off and on for about as long as they’ve been around. It’s now overly priced and even after paying a hefty amount for the Gold membership I still have to pay more money for simple features that should have been free to begin with. 
My second disappointment is that I do get a lot of matches. I travel for work so matches are constantly  piling in. 90% of those matches either don’t reply back or don’t talk to you at all. Which isn’t what I’m upset about with the app. It’s the fact that if I want to start cleaning out my matches from my account I have to individually go one by one to do it and I’m talking after a year of matches I have at least 200 woman I want to get rid of from my list. There needs to be a system where you can either select a time frame we can choose from for these matches to respond before they get removed as a match. Or they need to give us a clean up option where I can at least tap on who I want to unmatch from and remove them as a group instead of individually doing it. It’s a huge hassle.",Kyrie_caryn
Tinder,2021-09-09 01:40:28,Placeholder title,3,This app has many issues which range from being glitchy to the most important being fake accounts. The plethora of fake accounts is the single most flaw of this app beyond any other flaw. I’d rate this higher if it weren’t for other apps that are free and perform better among other reasons. No matter how many accounts I report there seems to be an endless flow of them. This as a user is frustrating since the use of the account is a waste of time due to it not achieving the goal for which it was created. However it isn’t always failing to reach this goal. In order to filter out some of the fake accounts it is in the best interest of the consumer or user to purchase a subscription which in my experience can be a gamble. My 3 stars are given due to the insatiable amount of fake accounts and bugs there are coupled with the fact that there are other platforms that are much simpler yet more consistently better.,albeltra
Tinder,2021-11-17 17:39:23,Icarus flying too close to the sun,1,"Tinder used to be the best dating/hook up app when it first released but now it is bombarded with overpriced and unreasonable subscriptions, obnoxious promotions even with platinum, glitch’s and bugs that will literally make this app counterintuitive and customer service that is so pointless and useless that you’re better off reading the troubleshooting guide that basically says “uninstall your app and reinstall it and if that doesn’t work you’re probably just ugly/uninteresting”. You will match with people and have full conversations that just vanish because either the person got banned or suspended and you wouldn’t know any better and or the app glitches/bugs and deletes the match entirely. I know this because I match with several personal friends and we will just vanish on each others tinder accounts and I check with support and they say our accounts are “working fine no problems or suspensions, try these troubleshoots”. Don’t waste your money or time, get hinge or just try your luck in the real world, this app has ruined online dating.",Robert storey:fight breast cancer
Tinder,2021-09-26 20:50:53,Just Bad,1,"Normally I don’t write reviews. But being banned for no reason showcases how people can abuse the system if they don’t like someone. Fat shaming is a thing. You guys don’t review, by them saying they take their policy seriously, is just them banning without any investigation. They’re app is complete trash. Because the reporting policy is meant to be abused. Unless you look a certain way, match the quota of other, tinder is made to marginalize, abuse, discriminate, and essentially get away with it. Other apps, I’ve never had a problem with, same photos, same essence, but tinder because I’m fat, I’m automatically banned for just going against their policy nothing else. And other things woman also have fallen victim to make abuse of false reporting, getting banned for no reason because tinder is too lazy to actually investigate their algorithm and reports. It’s quick to copy and paste the policy then to do the real effort of looking into things.

Don’t waste your time. They enable make narcissism. Money would be wasted since they don’t investigate. Any app but tinder would do more justice . Even bumble",theysuck3232
Tinder,2021-03-24 00:58:05,Bans/Shadowbans users for no reason,1,"I reported tinder to the better business bureau for banning me for no reason after OVER A YEAR of trying to get this resolved by their customer service. Finally after BBB contacted them they unbanned my account. But that was only the first step. I still can’t get any likes or matches anymore, and I’m a platinum member who is just throwing money away now. For those of you who are not familiar with this term, tinder “shadowbans” users and the only likes they get are from spam accounts, and they never receive matches. I’m one of those unlucky few. Tinder refuses to admit they’re doing this, but I know they are cause no matter how much I change my photos or move my location around the world, I receive 0 likes or matches after weeks of swiping. I used to get several likes and matches every day, all of which were real profiles. I have put in a second BBB complaint and I am awaiting a response now, if anyone has similar issues, report tinder to the better business bureau! Do not go through their USELESS customer service.

Tinder,2022-04-03 02:40:16,It’s true. They ban for absolutely no reason,1,"I wanna start off by saying that I am a very respectful person. I abide by every rule they have, with no questionable actions at all. Yet one day they sent me a request for review of my account. I sent the required pictures and within a couple days they replied saying that my account was banned because I had violated their terms of use/community guidelines. I kindly emailed their support team and all I get back is “we take our terms of use and community guidelines very seriously”. Ridiculous. I asked for for a specific reason because I know they can’t come up with one. Eventually they blocked me from emailing them (won’t send anymore) and now I don’t know how I can contact them for my refund… since they kept billing me for my subscription! I will look to escalate this further because it has been a total scam by such a big company. And I know so many others are in the SAME exact boat. If you’re reading this… you’re better off on another app. Or at least don’t spend money here because you might not get it back.",Killerrobot13
Tinder,2022-02-25 00:42:31,They Support Scam Accounts,1,"Well, they unintentionally support scam accounts. You can report a profile as a scammer; however, you can only do this when the profile is visible to you, so either when you are swiping or after you match. The problem is, if you match with a scammer, and add them on say snapchat as many people do with tinder, they can just unmatched you before attempting to scam you. And now, there is no way to report them. Now maybe you don’t think that’s a big deal cause you don’t fall for the scams, but that’s besides the point, you should be able to view profiles that unmatched you to report them. As trash as the app is, it would at least be better if half the people who match me weren’t scammers.

Besides that, it’s just an app that is preying on lonely people to make money. Telling them that if you pay more money you’ll find someone for you. Well I got news for ya, you won’t be any more likely, cause assuming you are matching with real people and not scammers, tinder can’t just force people to date you.

Tinder,2021-12-06 18:57:28,If it ain’t broke don’t fix it,2,"I have been a long time tinder user. I have had some success making connections through the app, I’ll give them that. However, there are certain things the app does that greatly decrease the quality of the experience. For one, recently, I have found that I cannot open profiles till I match with the person. This means I cannot read the majority of the information. After researching, I learned that this is part of beta testing for a possible future feature. I’d like to firmly say that I absolutely hate this. Also, I often find that the app ignores my preferences, showing me the profiles of literal teenagers. Why have an age filter if the algorithm will ignore it? I also find that often I become matched with people I am sure I never swiped right on. Many of my friends have also experienced this. I also wonder if tinder ever matches me with people who didn’t swipe right on me. In general, why offer features that the app itself than makes obsolete? Make it make sense.",snurt mgoo

I have noticed that the app significantly slows down my phone, to stop this I’ve tried closing down every app and only have Tinder open which doesn’t even work so it must be within the app itself which means I have to close the app and reopen it often. This is where the problem lies, I don’t get very many matches so I try to talk with mine as soon as I can, but just today on two separate occasions my phone slowed down while talking to people on the app so I closed it out and when I got back the were unadded, I do understand they could have but I had been talking to one for a couple of days and just matched with another so I find it very unlikely that these two girls both unadded me after my phone slowed down and I closed out the app 
I would really like this resolve I wish I could match with them again although I’m not sure if Tinder would allow that",_Gav1n

However, personal situation got in the way and I had to move across the country she wasn’t able to. We agreed we didn’t want a long distanced relationship and that we should go our separate ways. We’re still friends and there still is potential. We agree until we were able to live near by again, to see other people. I was in a new place and looking to meet people so I decided to recreate my account. As soon as I finished creating my account again I was told that my account t was banned.  I figured there would be a process to be able to clear your name from the banned list. I did some research and found that there is no way of ever getting unbanned. Nothing you can do to ever use the app again. Tinder won’t help you out either, they won’t even explain to you why you were banned.

Customer service was useless and offered no appeal or reason why I was banned besides “violating community guidelines.” They sent me an automated reply. Will be telling all of my friends and spreading the word to not use this app, as it’s a waste of time when they ban you randomly and you lose all your matches and people you have been talking to. It is ridiculous that such a huge company cannot take the time out of their day to provide decent customer service.

Tinder,2020-11-17 03:25:41,Shadowbanned Without Good Reason,5,"So I’ve been using tinder since 2015, literally over five years. I’ve paid for tinder plus, as well tinder gold throughout this time. Recently, I decided I wanted to reset my matches because I had too many to keep track of. Apparently tinder will shadowban you for re-making your account, which is not stated ANYWHERE in the terms of service that it’s against the rules. I’ve been an excellent customer for so many years, and this is how I’m re-paid. I’m extremely disappointed with this as there are actual bots and people that are causing issues on the platform and yet I break a “hidden rule” and can no longer make an account. I even tried using a different phone with a different number and apparently I’m just banned for life. Super disappointing, I’ll never recommend tinder to anyone ever again.",Jayleigh96

Then my friend got the app an hour after me and not even ten minutes in two girls I was with found him on their feed but not me. So i realized that my account was 1) not on anyone’s feed and 2) giving me the same couple girls over and over again. When I emailed the customer support because their phone number does not work I got a message saying that they would get a team on it, it’s been 3 days and I haven’t received word from them and I’ve sent three more emails all of which have not been answered. I then decided to try and delete my account to try again and it wont even let me do that.

I just made an account with tinder to meet new people around my new town that I just moved to and maybe find someone to have a relationship with but three days later my account is banned!!! I read the terms many times. I HAVE NOT VIOLATED A SINGLE ONE!!!! My profile was not inappropriate, I was not trying to sell anything and I was not harassing anyone!! I was only on for three days and only matched with one person that I didn’t even message yet. So I came to the conclusion that I was banned for what I do for a living (cam girl) because I added that in the job title part on my profile on the third day. JUST BECAUSE I’M A CAM GIRL DOES NOT MEAN IM NOT WORTHY OF FRIENDSHIPS / RELATIONSHIPS OF ANY SORT. Cam girls have a life too!! We’re just like everyone else. Stop bashing us and treating us differently like we’re some kind of strange creature and yes that’s exactly how you made me feel.

I have tried talking further to them but received nothing but automated emails that said I violated “terms of service and/or community guidelines” in many different phrases. I received an email from Martina that said “Unfortunately we cannot provide anymore detailed information at this time” and once again told me to refer to the community guidelines. Really REALLY disappointed in tinder for this shadowban and also can’t believe they couldn’t give me a specific reason as to why my account was banned.

Tinder,2023-04-13 17:28:11,If you are a woman don’t get this app,1,I’ve had tinder since 2018 off and on and never had a problem with it until recently. I opened the app one day to see I had been permanently banned. Days after redownloading the app. I had verified my account multiple times and even paid for tinder premium because I thought it would make for a better experience using the app and boy was I wrong. If you don’t answer a man within their set amount of time or do whatever they ask of you they will take it upon themselves to report your account and of course tinder gives you no way to dispute the claims or defend yourself. I emailed their customer service back and forth for a week for them to say that my account was fine on their end and whatever problem I was having unbanning my account was in fact just my problem. Of course tinder would make an option that lets men punish women for not being interested in them.

Tinder,2022-06-20 19:13:16,Horrible design and features all around,1,"This app always shows a notification badge, even when there are no new matches or unread messages. There is no way to mark all messages as read, so unless I delete or reopen every chat and match, the notification badge does not go away. Absolutely ridiculous. There’s no way to know when I actually have new notifications.

There also should be ways to customize how messages are displayed, and a date/time
stamp should be shown on the message list rather than requiring the message to be opened to see when the last message was sent. Messages aren’t even displayed in chronological order. Random old conversations get bumped to the top of the messages list with no rhyme or reason whatsoever. In addition to this, I am constantly shown the same profiles in my area that I have swiped left on numerous times. Finally, being able to undo an unintended left swipe should not be a feature only given in paid subscriptions. Whoever designs this app is very clearly incompetent and not keeping practical user experience in mind.

There are also features that are just stupid. One is where the app occasionally says “oops you missed a match” after swiping left on someone who liked you, as though the interest definitely must have been mutual, so you should therefore get the paid subscription in order to not make this “mistake” and “miss” a match again. Yes I may unintentionally swipe left but the app should not presume that’s what happened.",SDqbf2782

I asked a friend that I matched with on there to send me a message to see if I receive it, but they told me I am gone from their matches and they can’t see me. I can still see them on my matches though. You cannot call to talk to a human about what is going on, only send an email and hope for the best that a bot doesn’t decide to nuke your account for no reason. The customer service (I have paid to upgrade my membership) is nonexistent. You’re making money from us, pay to have humans that we can depend on.

For the past two years, I have had very disappointing results I am so grateful that tinder has added the option to display whether you are looking for short term long-term or testing the waters for your profile.
I have spent proximately $100 or more with Tinder gold and extra purchases in app 
I kid you not I have maxed out the amount of likes my profile has received (9,999)
It is so overwhelming and annoying. Trying to sort through the likes I receive to find anyone even close to similar interests.
If there was any way to sort things to where I could only see people who are of the same sexual orientation, and wanting long-term relationships, that would help me phenomenally
The amount of rage that overcomes my self when I’m dating someone only to find out that they had no intentions of long-term goals, someone who was only visiting town, someone who had a second partner. 
I try to be patient, I report every fake, inappropriate account I see but it’s never enough.

Tinder,2020-10-14 11:31:41,Tinder Lies and Steals,1,"I have been a tinder gold member for a while now and at first it all seemed legit. I was getting more likes and it was also nice to see who liked you already. The problem is, they don’t tell you everyone who has swiped right on you. I have a friend that saw me and swiped right on me and it didn’t not show up. This issue causes a slippery slope. This can possibly mean that a lot of people are missing out on potential matches because tinder feels as though it’s ok to lie and steal from their customers. Honestly it’s false advertising because they don’t 100% fulfill the perks that come with buying tinder gold (which is an outrageous price In the first place). I will no longer be paying for tinder and you should consider this review before making the same mistake. Also, some people don’t receive your messages even when they say delivered so keep ya heads up fellas your pick up line wasn’t that bad, tinder just decides whether or not you are worthy or not.

I even managed a date with someone from the app, they where a lot bigger then they lead to believe but that’s not a fault with the app. As time went on matches and likes started to drop off dramatically. I did some digging online and found a few articles stating: if you don’t buy premium they push your profile further back in the queue. Essentially without paying less people see your profile and you’ll end up less likely matching with people you liked. I’m not gonna pay 15 bucks a month just to get my profile visibility up. Follow that with half of the accounts being fake to gain followers on things like Instagram, Snapchat, and onlyfans. There a ton of fake accounts so much so that it’s extremely disappointing after getting so little likes and matches the few you get end up being fake accounts from India with terrible English and plugging for social media followers or personal information.

They keep telling me that is up to Apple to cancel my subscription but yet there’s no way for me to cancel this subscription this is very frustrating, so what they just get to keep taking my money?

Tinder,2023-03-02 12:13:43,The worst dating app.,1,"I used to enjoy this app occasionally and recently redownloaded it to find that everything is monetized and costs quite a bit. You now have a limit on how many swipes/ likes you get in a day and have to purchase more if you’d like to match. You no longer are able to super like (let people know you liked their profile) without buying them. Before you got like 3 a day. The price for Tinder Gold went up which would let you know who liked you (a standard free feature on other dating apps) and allow you to go back and fix a swipe/ like if you messed up. Also, now in between liking profiles they will send you ads as profiles that you have to swipe past as if they’re dating profiles. So they’re collecting ad revenue from you without giving you any new features, taking more away, and charging more for the services that existed? Make that make sense. Tinder was always known for low-quality hookup dating but at least it was fun to use. It was never the best dating app and now it stands as the absolute worst.",Lobsterman6000

Tinder used to immediately upon login give you all people that are interested in you first to feed through, before giving you additional people that haven't yet seen your profile. This was much more effective to gain matches and made the app more useful! I would swipe much more often just because I knew people would see when I was interested before profiles that has not yet and I would see when they were interested in me much more rapidly.
I get the idea that you now need to swipe more needing to use the app longer to gain matches, but I honestly have just stopped using tinder as a result of this. I am super disappointed in tinder. It used to be a fantastic app until the update messed this all up! I will be using OKCupid from now on.

Tinder,2020-11-28 21:43:59,From dating app to scam,1,"Tinder was once a good go to dating app. Not anymore. I began to notice that people messaging me were being banned. A few I had met so I asked them what happened. They had no idea. I thought it was strange. Then one day, I was banned from the app. I contacted them to ask why this had happened. I got the message that other reviewers have received. Basically saying I didn’t follow terms of service. Replying to messages seems to be perfectly fine on terms of service so that was not true. I asked them what specific reason was I banned since I was a paying member and had no idea why. I received no response. They banned me one day after charging me for the monthly service plan. 

Don’t fall for it. NEVER pay for Tinder. Second, they keep trying to charge you after they ban you. I ended my subscription and they still tried. I contacted apple and had Tinder blocked from charging me anymore.

Tinder,2023-03-21 18:11:44,Absolute dumpsterfire app,1,"Tinder used to be great. You can make friends and even have great relationships. Recently there have been many bots and not only that they BAN USERS WITHOUT EXPLANATION. Literally took a break from this app because i was in a relationship but when i came back, i got banned. I tried to ask for an explanation, even contacted support for a reason why I got banned, but as you guys have read many times, they literally send what i assume is a bot generated response saying that there is no appeal system. Once you’re banned, with no explanation provided, you are banned. I read over the terms and agreement, and i have not violated any terms and conditions.
One thing i can say to this company is if you can’t hire people to work in customer support to deal with these appeals, these guys make a ridiculous amount of money and they can’t make an appeal department to deal with these issues, but they have the time to think of subscription systems. With that money, you guys can just use other dating apps with better service.

Tinder,2023-03-18 00:24:50,Trash Pile,1,"This app was great a few years ago. It has since turned into an app where men must pay to even have their profiles shown to women. I used to get 20 matches per day and now I get maybe 1 per week. I certainly haven’t gotten that much uglier over the past 3 years. I really think the early years of Tinder were part of a longer term strategy - bait them in, show them the awesomeness - then pull the rug out from under them and make them pay for each morsel of the way things once were. Also, the liberal agenda behind these apps just gets old. They won’t let you filter by ethnicity, you can’t filter out transgendered “women”, they only offer tags like BLM,  LBGQ, Pronouns, Vaccinated, etc - they offer only liberal categories for everything. Dating apps, social media platforms and news media outlets are all hyper focused on transforming our society and our country into a giant pile of crap. Look around and ask yourself whether people really are happier now wallowing in this modern liberal trash pile than they were in the Leave it to Beaver days.",Joelj535
Tinder,2023-01-07 05:02:01,Banned for no reason. Verification team plays with users.,1,"Their team constantly falls for revenge reporting and bans you for no good reason. I’ve been verified a few times by Tinder before. This time I simply wanted to delete my account and the app would not let me. This is after I realized I had been shadow banned due to revenge reporting. I was getting only 5 likes when I usually get 99+ in less than an hour. And what does Tinder do? They know they’ve shadow banned you and let you keep playing for subscription and other services. This is unethical and shady. More importantly. there is something going on with their verification team - especially if you get the ones from overseas. They play with users. They send you through hoops asking you to send photos, after you have already deleted your photos, saying they want yo “Verify” that it’s you. How are that going to do they when I had already removed my photos and had a photo of a dessert because I wanted to delete my account? Do not trust Tinder. They have shady, unethical and questionable practices.",ReviewForApple

A little over a year ago I decided to give tinder a shot. My impression of tinder was tinder is just an app to find short term or just flings. I really didn’t have any expectations for tinder but only if it happens it happens, if not oh well. I decided to give it a shot and as of yesterday I made a year with someone who turned out to be very special in my life. I can honestly say she became my best friend And someone who I’ve came to love so dearly. We have been on many adventures already and hopefully more to come. It has been an exciting year. Now this is none of everyone’s business But just saying this to thank Tinder cause if it wasn’t for tinder, I wouldn’t have found my bestfriend/ love of my life.",Javier UM
Tinder,2021-10-19 01:27:14,Garbage 🗑,1,"Trash app. Terrible support. The app is so buggy and messed up. You have to pay to see who likes you and all this crap. It’s definitely a cash grab. The app claims there’s people in your area and that you need to “boost” your profile to get in touch with them! If you don’t boost your profile I guess the developers or whoever created this scam, won’t let you truly see who’s in your area or what not. You can pay to have/send read receipts and all sorts of money making schemes. Complete bull if you ask me. And it’s not cheap either. Especially for an app that is supposed to help you find a relationship. So sad 😞. Most of the time the app matches you with complete bots who are scammers and send you a WhatsApp link 🤡. And when you do match with someone you end up being like 1000 miles away from that match so what was the point really? Sad to see this is what it’s come to just to squeeze money out of people pockets.

Tinder,2021-08-22 16:39:41,"Stop Asking Me To Super Like, It Gets In The Way.",2,"I am interested in knowing how far away someone is, what line of work they’re in, whether they’re in school or not, and what kind of interests they have in a general sense, and that info is usually accessible at the same time that I’m tapping through the photos in a profile. That’s a helpful layout that allows me to make decisions more quickly. However, because of the location of the super like button directly below the profile info, any time that Tinder tries to influence my behavior by suggesting I super like, the helpful info above the row of icons is blocked from view by a pop-up text bubble. That’s disruptive to my preferred use of the app and seems counterproductive to what I assume is tinder’s goal of encouraging regular and/or prolonged engagement. Please let us disable in-app notifications of this type. I know how to Super Like and I have thought about when I would and wouldn’t like to Super Like. Please stop telling me to consider Super Liking profiles.",Chaz Appman
Tinder,2021-06-10 11:44:37,Banned… for what?!,1,I’ve been using tinder on and off for 2-3 years.. never once had an issue. Upgraded my account to tinder gold was paying for boosts and super boosts since I recently moved outta state it was a easier way for me to meet and make friends etc. I paid for a super boost. Let it do it’s thing. I check my account and to my surprise I was banned. I had no inappropriate pictures I had nothing on my bio that went against guidelines. I email the “support” team and they said they aren’t doing appeals at this time. I never got a reason as to why my account was banned. I paid for a super boost for no reason cause as I look back my matches weren’t even loading and we’re giving me error messages so mid super boost my account was already in the process of being banned. I just don’t understand why tinder is doing this to people. Least you can do is let us appeal and get our accounts back. I don’t get what the issue is reviewing people’s accounts.  I’ll never recommend tinder to anyone after this situation. So inconvenient and upsetting.,yani_babiee

I messaged support and all they can say is “you violated our Terms of Use OR community guidelines”... or???? So y’all don’t even know why you banned me?! I’ve been using tinder for a while. I would tell all my friends and anyone else looking for a relationship to join because I found a great relationship on here that lasted 2 1/2 years but not anymore. If you’re just gonna randomly ban someone and not give a clear answer as to why, and not even let them try to appeal it then that’s not something I want to support or tell others to. I literally did nothing wrong and clearly neither have other people. Y’all need to get this straightened out because clearly your automated bots that check to make sure people are following your community guidelines is jacked up because it’s banning people for no reason.

Tinder,2020-11-08 04:09:46,Verification process,5,"Ok so something is majorly wrong with this app. I went ahead and signed up and made a profile which took me like an hour! Very time consuming to get the right pictures and say the right thing. Then in mid swipe, it asked me to “ verify I am a human!” What?? So I went through the verification process over and over again. It was “pick the incorrect shadow!! “ Really? I could barely make out what the pics were or what was the wrong “ shadow” yikes! It was creepy. It kept saying I got it wrong but when I finally got it right and it said well done it made me do another verification with a weird animal (I think...) and asked me to name the correct one upside down?!? I’m embarrassed to even admit I actually spent time doing this!

Tinder,2020-10-15 21:36:27,Tinder only wants your money,1,"I installed Tinder about two weeks ago, early October, 2020. After two weeks, I have concluded that it is horrendously bad. I estimate that around 70-80% of the female profiles are fake, spam, scams, bots, fronts for escorts/prostitutes, foreign scammers (mostly Asian and Russian), or actual women trying to get people to follow them on SC, IG, or their OnlyFans accounts. It’s not worth the time/effort to find someone who might be real and actually looking to date. I don’t know what it’s like for the women, but this is the experience for men.

I am a software architect and programmer. I can think of multiple ways that Tinder and other dating apps could weed out the vast majority of the fake accounts. And I’m sure Tinder knows how to do those things as well. I’m guessing they don’t because they’ve realized that the existence of those fake accounts make Tinder more money. They’re not interested in actually helping people find relationships, they only care about making as much money as they can as fast as they can.

Tinder isn’t a dating app. It’s not even a hookup app. It’s a way for Tinder make money. Period.",r.lockstone

I’ve had this app for 2 years and probably only got 100 likes in that span of time and probably same amount of matches that lead to nowhere and I’m sure I’m a part of the reason but at the same time I get a like and open the app to see what the girl looks like then boom the likes gone for reasons I can’t control it’s either that or some girl built like a linebacker for the nfl is liking me. Now I don’t shame people for their physique because everyone has their preference. And mine is not that. However, the tinder algorithm can’t seem to detect crap so that’s what I’m stuck with. The platinum membership is a complete shakedown when it comes to the amount of likes which doesn’t increase at all and is just disappointing. I feel at a complete impass when using this thinking maybe if I wait longer it will finally happen, but it doesn’t which is probably why this app makes so much revenue.",Aksnxoksbdkxjsb

I’ve downloaded tinder on and off over the past 7+ years using the same account but updating my pictures and bio as I saw fit. Tonight I redownloaded it again and was almost immediately banned for seemingly no reason. I have a normal profile with very little inappropriate skin showing, no racist or offensive remarks in my bio or pictures, never done any of that in the past, read their guidelines and didn’t seem to break any of them. I matched with one person and sent them 2 messages and opened the app to respond again and was permanently banned from my account or making new accounts in the future. The only thing I can figure is that someone must have reported me but for what? Why wouldn’t tinder look at my profile before permanently banning me? I literally haven’t done anything and now I can’t use one of the most popular dating apps out there. They need to seriously fix their algorithms and reporting structure.",RitualSpice

I used it just as i normally would and in the exact manner as the platform is designed. When across their Mexican border, came back and randomly account had been banned. I wrote customer support and explained I had not tampered with or done anything I normally would have done (basically swiping, matching and then moving outside of the platform in order to make a real connection). They said they don’t offer appeals but also wouldn’t tell me what terms I violated. This was also after I subscribed to the Gold account. I now was charged and banned from Tinder for what seems to be a random violation that they can not and will not bring evidence of any foul play to the table. Tinder had random people soliciting sex and they have profiles active. So if you are going to use this app be weary of no support what  so ever .",Wickedsix04
Tinder,2022-01-10 15:34:03,Tinder Ruined an Entire Generation,1,"You won’t find a relationship on Tinder, especially as a male. And if by some miracle you get around all the pay-walls, ego boosters, and angle abusing overweight people, they 9 times out of 10 won’t be right for you. Tinder preys on instant attraction, which isn’t true love. It just leads to a relationship based on lust, which is like building a house on sand. It serves to gratify the self through the satisfaction that someone else thought you were attractive. 

The amount of single mothers I’ve matched with who have told me they met the child’s father on Tinder is absurd. Tinder is the result of a generational fault, and it will sadly remain a plague on the world for the foreseeable future so long as desperate people still think their soul mate is just a swipe away. 

If you’re a college student, a senior in high school, or a post grad, you’ve been warned. Don’t fall into the trap. I promise, you’ll meet the right with one time.

Tinder,2021-06-03 05:00:14,Terrible app.,1,This is the worst thing that has happened to society. The app and the algorithms use are so biased and prejudice. The app is not designed to look out for a little man at all I've use that for quite some time and I have realized that if your profile is not flashy and catchy you will be put to the bottom of the stack. And don't you dare spend money on the app because they will give you one match per boost used if it's the first boost of the day. Occasionally more than that but very very seldomly. Think about it if the Company is making money off of you they don't want you to end up in a successful relationship because their money stops there. So they try to influence you into spending more money in hopes of getting more matches in hopes of eventually finding your significant other of your dreams but it's all A lie and a scheme. And I know that with COVID-19 getting out and mingling in person is a lot harder than it used to be but that is your best bet far as making new friends and creating new relationships because tinder is flawed to the roots.,Big man 123abc123

Tinder has changed a lot. If you super like, none of them will likely see it unless you buy into Platinum, which says it shows your profile to your liked people “faster”. Okay so what’s tinder Gold for? Because passport is obsolete now that you showing my profile everywhere instead of locally. So that’s not working feature(which I pay for). Every tinder Gold feature that I paid for is essentially obsolete. I can swipe all i want, but that doesn’t matter much because you show me people in another country i could care less about.

Tinder,2020-12-02 21:06:20,Yet another... ban for no reason,1,"It’s clear that tinder doesn’t care about their users, or make an attempt to provide a worthwhile service. We could go down the list of tinder’s failures, but I’m addressing one thing in particular. I’ve been banned for quite literally no reason. Tried contacting them, no response or resolution. They won’t even tell me what I did(not do). Further more, this seems to be a surprisingly common issue. A lot of people are experiencing permanent bans for no reason, and tinder thinks this is okay? If I had to guess, I’d hypothesize that some disgruntled user decides to report you (for whatever reason, maybe they just don’t like your face, maybe an ex, who knows??) and tinder just automatically bans the person reported without investigating a lick.

 Let it be known, that I HAVE read the terms and guidelines and I have NOT violated a single one. As well, I have never said anything even remotely disrespectful or creepy; that runs counter to who I am as a person.

That happened three times, but this last time I actually deactivated my account because I met someone. When that didn’t work out, I returned to the app only to be met with an explanation that my account had been banned citing that I had violated Tinder’s Terms and Conditions. How could it have been banned when it hadn’t even been active? I pointed this out to Tinder support but received an email that they don’t have an appeals process, which is unfortunate. I’m inclined to believe that they don’t actually review reports on accounts to see if they’ve actually violated Terms and Conditions but they instead just go ahead and ban accounts.

Tinder,2023-04-16 17:36:56,Phantom Notification,1,"I don’t use tinder often. But my main issue with the app is that there is a phantom notification. It always has a red 1, meaning one unread notification on iPhone. However there are none. I go into the app and look under every section and sub section possible but no matter what the notification never disappears. Some times if I get an actual notification and check that after the phantom notification disappears but only for a few hours until it returns again. Only real way to get rid of it is by disabling all tinder notifications which then makes it pointless if do you get a match. May just have to delete the app for good. Second most annoying thing is you have to pay for everything, more swipes, boosts, super likes, etc. I get it is a business and they want to make money but it makes the app very limited. Third annoying thing is you can not block people before actually matching with them. Only way to block is if you match with them first and the block. Do better Tinder.",TheAppKnight

I even apologized on my behalf of anything I did wrong even though I know for a fact I did nothing wrong. I usually wouldn’t have been bothered by the situation but tinder is honestly the only way I make friends I am very anti social and don’t get out much and I was slowly getting closer to making friends through this app only to randomly be banned which is seriously unfair with the amount of harassment I’ve gotten from people on this app. I still keep trying to reach out but am getting nowhere, I’m hoping this will be read by support so they can see that it’s a pattern and it’s happening to people who don’t deserve it.",Chocolate Thunda15

He then tells me he reported my Snapchat and tinder after sending me a bunch of very rude Snapchat messages. Telling me I need education and Jesus and a bunch of other rude things. Then blocks me. Then I go on the app and I see a rude message from him, then he blocks me on there. I then close the app only to find 10 minutes after opening it again that I have been banned and I have no idea why. He obviously reported me and said I did something that I did not and I have no idea what I was reported for. It must have been something bad in order to be banned and I don’t appreciate it.

Tinder,2020-09-22 13:18:25,Scam. Waste of time and Money.,1,"***REAL REVIEW FROM SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY USES THE APP DAILY**** 

I wish I could give it zero stars. Tinder is by far the worst. I don’t think that anyone that works at Tinder actually uses Tinder. How it became so mainstream is beyond me. I have reached out on multiple occasions about reporting fake profiles with the response basically being sorry. You report one profile and 10 more pop up in its place or you see the same profile a few hours later. Some are blatantly fake with pics of porn stars and bios with misspelled words and bot created Snapchat names. Some even go as far as just putting a cashapp in the bio.  If that doesn’t scream fake/scammers idk what does. Tinder has become a hub for scammers. For every real profile there are 100 fake ones. Whatever the verification process is obviously doesn’t work.  I have many ideas on how to improve it but I think I’m going to just design my own app to compete with the nonsense that is a tinder.  Tbh save you time honestly.

I really want to be able to use this app again as I feel like I did nothing wrong but there is seemingly no one to get in touch with about this issue and judging from the comments this is a pretty common issue for users right now.

I just feel insulted to be told by the app that gaming isn’t a hobby, so I must fall into one of three categories, either I play Fortnite, league of legends, or both. I wouldn’t care about the new tags if they left the old one, and even like some of the new tags they added, but how is board games a valid hobby, but video games not one?

After contacting their customer service multiple times with my concern, I received apathetic replies from Tinder customer service reiterating that the ban is permanent, and they refused to inform me of how I violated the Terms of Use or Community Guidelines. If you do a simple search on the internet, this situation is widespread with many reports of unethical bans resulting in no refunds for paid services.

Tinder,2022-12-11 17:05:17,Matches are hella dry.,3,I’ve had tinder for about 3 years and NEVER met anyone on the app irl:/ I’d say I’m pretty decent looking dude honestly. Had lots of matches but NONE have ever left the chat room. Plenty of them just match and don’t say a word. There should be a time limit of like a week or 2 to talk to someone before they disappear and you never see em again. Good way to deduce bots and scammers. Tinder gold is dogwater because it limits the amount of attention u get bc it’s trying to push u to buy boosts that seem pretty much useless imo. Had a 3 month subscription and sadly got no play. And I rizz too. Oh well still get em in real life tho. Plus FOR THE LOVE OF GOOD give the transgenders and homosexuals their OWN dating pools or categories or whatever you want to call them. I’m a STRAIGHT male and I’m tired of seeing gay dudes and transgender women popping up in my feed from time to time. Not homophobic or anything it’s just really annoying. Bisexual women welcome ofc:),Fox Nation 18
Tinder,2020-09-12 19:11:00,Just plain AMAZING,5,"It’s so ironic that dating apps could be so cliché when looking for love, but that’s exactly how it ended up with me. I married the person who I met through this dating app & he ended up being my everything, my rock, my best friend, a man that I could never live without. 5 years & 2 little boys later, we are so beyond happy & very much head over heels for each other still (Cheesy? Sorry, just wanted to share my experience of joy I had with this app.) Now, is it too good to be true that you could possibly meet your soulmate through dating apps? NOPE I don’t think so, as a matter of fact I truly believe that anyone could meet their Mr. or Ms. Right anywhere as long you are careful & know that your heart truly belongs to that right person. So this is by far the best dating apps I’ve experienced with so far, & I definitely highly recommend this. 💯",ajx3__
Tinder,2023-01-23 02:24:07,Pay for Matches,1,"I’ve had this app for 7 years. I’ve noticed that the only time I match with someone is when I’m a good member. It’s like they purposely don’t show you people that liked you or vice versa that they will not show your profile when you swipe right. It seems to be a ploy to say “hey you have 8 matches waiting, upgrade”. Funny how I never get a like when I’m a paid member though. My mileage from location is way off. I see all these profiles that are supposedly within my set mileage limit. When you see where there from its hundreds of miles off. I’ve tried to delete my account and redo it. Still same issues. In 7 yrs, I think I matched with maybe 4 people. For the record, I know my limitations and don’t swipe on the fake models or woman out of my league. I believe I’ve swiped right to hundreds of profiles in the years and 4 matches (only when I’m a paid member) though. I’ve swiped left to hundreds as well.

I reached out to Customer Support to find out why seeing as I’ve never done anything to violate the terms of service. They responded with a canned email stating that they take this very seriously and the decision is final. I explained to them that I understand their decision is final and it’s not eligible for review but I would like to know why I was banned. They responded with another canned email stating that their decision is final and it’s not eligible for review. I responded again asking not for review but why I was banned, some sort of explanation as a paying customer. They responded with the same email from my first inquiry. There’s so many fakes on this app and yet they go around banning a paying customer (with no explanation) that’s never done anything wrong… good luck Tinder you’re gonna need it.. maybe spend your time cleaning up the fakes before terminating the real..",Petre13
Tinder,2022-05-26 09:37:21,I get the pay tiers but,1,"The amount of notifications you get for not subscribing to the platinum subscription tier is borderline harassment.  Multiple times per day you get push notifications worded in a way to try to get you on the fear of missing out, “oh sorry you missed somebody because you aren’t paying us $30 per month” tinder is absolutely not worth $30 every month.  Nearly every other swipe you get obnoxious in-app notifications that you can’t turn off “hey you’re missing a feature because we want more money and you’re not giving it to us” 

Reviewers are correct, you don’t need to pay to use the app.  You might miss a couple extra features that are useful or just cool but you’re not getting locked out of matching with somebody just because you don’t pay. I’m happy to pay the basic price to remove ads, I get that companies have to make money, that’s the world we live in now. It’s enough to make me want to delete the app entirely with how many you get just begging you to give them more money.",Yeahitwasme

Also the fact that this app locks 2 features that should be accessible to everyone is so ridiculous, 1. There should be no daily swipe limit. 2. You should be able to see who likes you at no cost. This app is awful, trust me when I say this IT IS BETTER TO BE ALONE AND BE ON NO DATING APPS THEN TO BE ALONE AND ON DATING APPS. Save your money don’t waste your time.",Stevngilbow
Tinder,2022-04-13 03:28:02,Irritating and pointless notifications,2,"The app works perfectly fine. I do wish they would bring back some free super likes. But what irritates me are the constant pointless notifications. Less than a minute after I close the app, there is invariably a notification telling me “oops, you missed a match” which comes up so frequently that it’s obviously not true. It is clearly only there to try to get me to open the app yet again and thus see their ads again. I don’t need to know about “swipe surge” whatever that is. I’m sure that “someone likes me open to find out who” would be great to know but you’re not gonna tell me unless I pay for it. You cannot turn off these notifications and they leave that little red notification dot on the app icon. So if you want to turn them off you have to turn off all notifications for the entire app. But then you won’t get message and new match notifications – which are the only ones I actually want.",artchortle
Tinder,2022-04-11 01:46:07,The App continues to find ways to waste your time,1,"First off, I’d like to say that I’m coming at this review from the perspective of someone who thinks the app’s features have the potential to make the experience amazing (when working as intended). The main issue with the app is that there are too many annoying and repetitive bugs that completely destroy the user experience. 

First off, why even have an option to “only show people in this range” if every other profile you show is 2000+ miles away from the range I set? I mean, I get it. The app runs out of users to show you after a while and is forced to recommend profiles outside the range. But then why not just say that the app has run out of profiles and leave it at that? My guess is that the devs are trying way too hard to waste people’s time and keep them on the app as long as possible.

Second, literally every other swipe I get a notification that says “Super like to increase your odds by 5x.” Now, I personally wouldn’t care about the constant notification. But it’s literally right above the profiles distance for you. Which is the number. one. consideration. when deciding on whether to swipe right or not. Again, this goes back to my initial theory that the devs are looking for ways to keep users on the app. 

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve logging out and back in, deleted the app and it’s data. Nothing fixes these issues, because they’re not bugs, they’re features.",Hillary$wank
Tinder,2022-03-20 16:55:10,Consumer Unfriendly Marketing Practices,1,"The title of the review is an understatement. If you are not prepared to shell out almost 40$ a month for their platinum membership (where the app is actually functional) don’t bother getting this app. 
   The app will work against you in every possible way not to match you with the people that liked YOU to try to get you to subscribe.
   I am all in support for pay for convenience apps or just purchasing the membership when they are straight forward to you about it, but when they advertise the app as free and try and use these methods to manipulate you into a subscription is cringe. 
   And for an app where such a big portion of users are there to seek out drug dealers or promote their social media, it’s a joke. 
   Take your money and go to your local speed dating event where you can meet some people that are there for the same reason as you are and not get catfishes, or use a different app. This is a casino of online dating where the only ones who are winning are Tinder, and the very few users.",Syrudhdgshvvagxhd Sydney
Tinder,2022-01-15 22:19:34,There is no appeals process,1,"Someone crazy can just file a false report and that’s it. No warnings no explanation, no logic… just boom! You’re banned. 

I have a crazy ex who somehow must have made a fake account and I guess I matched with it and then she reported me and got me banned and when I reached out to Tinder they just sent me their terms and guidelines and said they take it seriously and that I am banned. But they never could show me how I broke any term and guidelines even though I repeatedly asked. They just kept saying there is no appeals process and they take violations very seriously… and after repeatedly telling them I didn’t want to appeal, I just wanted to know how I violated anything. Not even to argue against it or anything. Just to know what the accusation was. But they just kept saying the same thing over and over again. Horrible policies… someone who is bitter about rejection and is crazy can somehow report you and get you banned for life. Watch yourselves and your crazy exes. They will make fake accounts to trap you and make false reports.",CG Advice
Tinder,2022-01-10 23:30:56,They randomly ban people,1,"So many people get banned from this app for NO REASON. Yet they don’t even have an appeals process in place. If you try to contact them all they do is copy and paste a message telling you to check their community guidelines. It’s very frustrating and they don’t help at ALL. It’s unfortunate that so many use this app and not others, so the dating pool on other apps is just smaller. Hopefully people will stray away from tinder and start using others.

Apart from their ridiculous banning system, they keep dropping features from their subscriptions, and raising the prices. They clearly only care about money. Which is why it also doesn’t make sense that they are completely fine with banning people that have a subscription for absolutely no reason too.

Save yourself the trouble and just don’t download it. If you just want to use it very briefly then maybe. But if you want a consistent app to use, try another one. You’ll just end up getting banned from this one after a few weeks.",nnn889

A few days ago as soon as I opened my account I saw the words “account banned for violating terms and conditions”. I was shocked because I had never said anything bad to anyone, my account had appropriate pictures, and my account was based on the real me with real pictures of myself. I tried contacting customer care and they just kept saying the same response of not being able to help me and that there is no appeals process. This is crazy because I didn’t do anything wrong and when trying to ask what exactly I violated they would just say they can’t go into specifics and that I violated the terms and conditions.

I’ve emailed support twice and get the automated response of being banned for violating their terms of service, which had never happened, and that there is no appeals process to unban or reinstate an account. What???? I combed through and read the terms of service and their community guidelines and haven’t done anything wrong to violate any of their guidelines or terms.

This confuses me because I haven’t been doing anything that the app isn’t meant for. There’s literally no way to contact ANYONE to ask more questions and there’s literally no way for me to make a brand new account using a new email. I also find it conveniently planned that after my monthly subscription payment goes through, my account gets banned the next day. So go ahead tinder, steal my money and then ban me for no reason at all.  Updating months later: I still haven’t been able to contact ANYONE to ask why I’ve been banned and there’s no way for me to try and create a new account.  If you’re thinking of downloading tinder, I would suggest finding another app to download.

Tinder,2020-11-09 04:57:09,App’s Getting Worse with each Update,3,"Tinder as a concept is great. You log on, swipe to your heart’s content, and meet new people. No need for a bunch of features to add to your profile. It’s simple. Wonderful idea. At one point the app worked perfectly too, but as time’s gone on and more updates come out the UI/UX has gone down a lot. UI features go missing randomly, never to be seen again unless you reinstall. Videos won’t upload; sometimes they won’t even show up. When they do upload, it’s 50/50 on whether or not other’s can see them, as profiles glitch often. As time’s gone on, the app just gets more buggy. I think it could just be the way they’re updating the app, but the experience on Tinder just isn’t what it used to be. It’s a shame because I actually do still like the app, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t displeased/expecting better. Please look into the bugs.

Tinder,2022-05-08 17:05:30,Banned for not violating terms of service.,1,"I never harassed anyone, never got in to arguments, didn't post inappropriate pictures, had nothing offensive in my profile, never treated my dates cruelly, never spammed anyone....then this week - banned. I reach out to customer service to ask why. They responded that I violated the terms of service. I told them that I reviewed the terms of service and I violated none of them and asked if they could tell me the specific reason I was banned. They said they couldn't because they don't have that information.....

I pride myself on conducting myself respectfully and being kind to those around me. The ONLY thing I can guess is the day before I was banned I went on a date with a man who claimed he was 34. The second he showed up he tried to kiss me despite me telling him ""no,"" then confessed that he was 44. My only response was to say, ""ok. I'm leaving"" and I left. No yelling. No fighting.

Tinder,2021-10-12 01:54:02,Scam,1,"Not worth a penny to spend on this scamming app. Before you pay they’ll advertise all kind of   benefits as of you can message others and your able to see unlimited profiles but after you pay them not only your not able to see unlimited people they want to charge you in app purchase to boost your own paid profile to be able to see more profiles and on the top of that there is now way of messaging anyone and 90% of the profiles ate fake they keep repeating them until you press like . I have canceled it after 2 days of paying the first month. Would not recommend this fake app to anyone. These people are taking advantage of the single guys over fake pictures to pocket their peoples money. Also they want you to global and looking at pictures from 1000s of miles away, come on you creatures of tinder if someone is looking for relationship in our age they rather have it locally not a long distance relationship.

Tinder,2022-06-11 18:14:09,Really need to crack down on OnlyFans,2,"Tinder is great. I’ve gotten lots of pleasant matches over the years. I’ve noticed we get fewer right swipes than before and that’s fine. Seems like all of this is done to promote their Plus and Gold subscriptions. Great, gotta monetize somehow right?

What irks me is the insane amount of fake profiles. The ones that immediately invite you to chat on WhatsApp or Snapchat. I once added a “girl” on Snapchat and said if I buy content we could meet up. I pulled up her Snapchat location and she was near Libya. Nah fam.

The other overwhelming majority of users is girls that are only there to promote their Instagram… which promotes their Onlyfans. Can we just eliminate anyone there for the sole purpose of getting followers and subscribers? IG tags should be identified and removed. Unless Tinder is just the place to find followers. These people are ruining the experience and I’ve never seen it this bad. The amount of booty holes I could see for $7.99 a piece is actually annoying.",Mr. Ragee
Tinder,2023-04-11 02:52:02,Advertisements for paid subscription members,1,"I deleted my account halfway through my first month of gold membership because it's that useless to me. The app will continue to hound you with ads to buy various paid one-use items AFTER already paying them a subscription fee, that's needed to just see who likes you're profile at all. So basically to match with anyone if you have a free account, you both have to like each other's profile without knowing that the other did it. Do you know how unlikely that is to happen? Also the user-base seems to be 99% people who could find work in modeling while I'm just some guy. No way would I have any chance on this app. Also it doesn't even ask for basic information like political or religious beliefs. If I have to match with someone just to find out that they're not compatible with me anyway, why would I want to use this app for any long-term relationship?

Tinder,2022-12-27 01:29:44,Basically all spam,1,"There are a few verified profiles and once in a while you’ll get a match but from my experience it’s lots and lots of reused profiles I’ve swiped left on countless times. I had the paid version for years and now it’s not worth it at all. I’ve also had to turn off notifications completely for tinder because the company non stop sends messages wanting me to upgrade to gold, or buy super likes, or boost my profile. I get a notification and think it’s a match but nope, it’s just the tinder peeps begging for money for their pathetic app. It would not shock me at all to see news down the road about what a scam this app has been all along. I made the switch to hinge a few weeks ago and it’s exponentially better on all levels. The goal of hinge is to actually get people to meet and while I haven’t yet there are a couple of very promising leads. The filters on hinge also blow tinder filters away.

The only time I’ve been close to going on a date is when the girl charges money for it (which I think is actually illegal). Maybe I’m just bad with small talk, but I’ve had friends who are low-key womanizers do entire conversations for me and still get nowhere. Maybe I’m just ugly, idk. Also, I don’t get why there’s a 12 hour wait between swipe sessions. The only purpose it serves is to make it so that you have to swipe right when you get up in the morning if you want to get two sessions in a day. It should really be 11 hours or 10 hours since no average human is going to exploit that to get like 2.15 swipe sessions per day.

I know for a fact I did nothing violating the tinder terms of service that would get me banned. I work as a nurse and think i am genuinely pretty kind and innocent. I have absolutely no idea why I was banned as I will reiterate, I BARELY even message anyone let alone say anything rude or against their terms of service. I reached out to tinder twice asking for an explanation and of course they told me they could not give me any information.

I can back to say that out of all the people who just said hi I meant someone 3 years ago who wanted a relationship behind hi how are you doing.

I read thousands of complaints from other users that complained about the same issue. I don’t know them so I can only vouch from my own experience.

Tinder,2021-12-24 21:04:21,Tinder is taking advantage if you in many ways,2,"Straight to the point.
1. Either intentionally fills its database with fakes or turns a blind eye on the rampant fake issue. It’s so bad that the same profile you might have reported 20 times will still pop up. This could have been easily remedied by pattern recognition, same thing that allows you to unlock you iphone. Most of the fakes have photos stolen from IG. Smaller portion of them are deepfakes mostly of Asian women.
2. Even the verified profiles with blue tick mark are often catfishing or are engaged in prostitution.
3. Recently (i noticed in December)Tinder downgraded its Gold subscription to give only 5 superlikes per week from what was 5 a day that is almost 85% decrease in benefits that came with Gold.
4. You could buy 5 superlikes for 7.99 or smth like that now it’s only 3 for $10.
5. Tinder will bait you with incredibly attractive people until you will be asked to get Superlikes, once you got them profiles will noticeably shift toward more realistic. At which point Tinder will tell you you need a boost to get noticed.
6. All this jacking came at the peak of third wave and holidays. Exactly when people are lonely and are desperate for even a conversation.
Tinder is a corporate scam that isn’t being scrutinized enough. Remember they paid $23M in CA class action lawsuit because of age discrimination pricing.

Never harassed anyone, never uploaded any nudity, never did really anything wrong or immoral and yet I get permanently banned for THIS of all things, something that was perfectly allowed up until the last year and now all of the sudden just isn’t anymore for some stupid reason? The worst part about this is that even if you get a new device and re-download Tinder, you’re still banned because they ban both your device AND your whole phone number that it forces you to link with your account for this exact reason. God, not even Grindr is this bad and they LOVE their unjustified bans there because at least you can make a new account on a new device with them. And from what I’ve read, their support team is completely useless because they won’t ever respond to you.

They put off meeting even though they supposedly live near you. Eventually that becomes pointless interaction and you end up just blocking them. Almost like clockwork, another profile matches with you a week or two later, and the same thing happens. But it seems to be an interval *designed* to keep you engaged--and thus paying--in the app. The entire app is seemingly just a SCAM. Don't bother.",ozoneic
Tinder,2021-10-28 16:41:25,BANNED FOR NO REASON,1,"Out of nowhere in the middle of me using Tinder, I get a notification popping up on my screen saying that my account has been banned because I violated the Terms of Service. Mind you, I have been using Tinder on and off for years, have bought multiple subscriptions, and have had no problems until now. This is quite upsetting, especially when I had a active gold membership. Not only that, upon reaching out to customer service they are not able to give me details as to why my account has been banned. I asked them, “ so in the instances that there may have been an accidental ban or a ban that was initiated under false pretense, what do you do?” I have told “representatives” on this customer service system repeatedly that this ban was not justified and I would like to speak to a supervisor. 

This is by far the worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life! I have invested a good amount of time and money into Tinder and for my experience as a valued customer to be disregard is very mind-boggling.",Ezzebre
Tinder,2021-01-24 05:55:57,"4,000 miles away?  Reported person showing up",2,"I’ve been swiping for a solid 15 minutes and all I’m seeing are profiles from 100, 700, 1,000, and even 4,000 miles away? I have my location set to a maximum of 20 miles. I can understand if someone was in the area for a bit and swiped on me, left the area, then them showing up. But that is really not likely when the last 50 profiles I swiped on are up to 4,000 miles away. I could also understand if someone was just outside my maximum distance by 5 or so miles. It’s really annoying. I don’t want to swipe on people that far away from me. Respect my distance settings, tinder. Just another ploy to keep people swiping.  🙄

Also, I reported someone last week because we hung out and he was pushing boundaries and wouldn’t stop even when asked. Not only is he still on the app, but he showed up on my swipes today. If someone is reported, at least be decent enough to not have their profile come up on the person who reported them’s swipes.",Psolms
Tinder,2022-10-11 01:51:04,They got rid of verified only,1,"The verified only was one of the few features that this app had going for it. It was hard enough finding real people even when there was a verified only section, but now it’s just a waste of time. I’ve probably matched with hundreds of people on this app. Briefly got a dysfunctional utilitarian relationship out of it I guess. My main concern would be that there can be times when nobody responds to your messages and other times when you get multiple people messaging you at once. It can be overwhelming and impersonal. I hope they bring back verified only because it’s safer and there’s much less bots wasting your time. There’s also a high emphasis on superficial things and little emphasis on deeper personality traits. I’m mature enough to know that mutual attraction is important in a relationship, but I’m also mature enough to know there’s a lot more to a relationship than just sex appeal. In summary tinder is a money making app first and a dating app second. Please bring back verified only.",dank. sauce.
Tinder,2022-08-22 23:08:19,Banned for absolutely no reason,1,"I used Tinder ever since I turned 18 (I’m 19 now) I am a gay man and there aren’t many gay men in my area so I have it to just meet and communicate with people like me! I recently payed for Tinder for just one month to see if I could actually find anyone serious about dating. But before my one month trial ended I got on the app to see that I was banned. I was trying to think back to anything I could’ve said or done that would’ve triggered this… but I could think of nothing that would violate the community guidelines because I am respectful and kind. I didn’t use any inappropriate pictures and I follow all the rules. 

It’s said because I tried to write to Tinder about my experience of being banned and because I wanted an explanation but they gave me a bogus response. I think it’s crazy that so many good people just get randomly banned. Tinder seriously and immediately needs to rethink this process because they’re banning a lot of genuine people who are serious about dating.

My time, money, and effort has been wasted and I am not too mad about it but it’s just the principle that this can happen is bothersome because I know I did nothing wrong.

Also, I was receiving random dm’s from random accounts on Instagram saying that I matched with them when I did not. Nor had I ever heard or seen this people before!? Maybe that had something to do with it… like someone may have been using my pictures on a fake account!?",d20_wl02
Tinder,2022-03-22 04:04:51,Waste of time,1,"I got out of my last relationship in October of 2021. Because i’m young, not in school, and working full time, I found it pretty hard to run into people naturally. So, after a couple months I finally cracked. I think I have been on and off this app a few times since December and I have matched with 3 people (all without any response). I have friends who seem to be the kingpins of dating apps, i’ve made every change and mirrored exactly what works for them, the only difference is I refuse to put any money into this app. If you’re looking to actually meet someone, you’re in the wrong place if you’re on Tinder (unless you’re planning to dump half your salary into it). This app has slowly been rebuilt to cater to those who seek validation by seeing how many likes they’re getting, Tinder isn’t bringing anyone together. If you’re reading this and haven’t already had the worst experience of your life, I recommend you exhaust every other option before you even consider joining Tinder.",B_orsburn1
Tinder,2020-11-02 01:07:49,Disgustingly Transphobic,1,"I was on tinder for about 4 months, and actually had a pretty good time and met a decent number of people. I am trans. Eventually, I randomly received the “tinder trans ban,” which is apparently a frequent occurrence wherein trans people get banned because transphobes report us for no reason and tinder automatically bans accounts with enough reports. I was upfront that I was trans—it was right in my profile, so I’m assuming I was literally reported by like 5 or 6 transphobes in my 4 months on tinder and they just went off and banned me for it. I also received multiple transphobic messages, like from a woman who literally displayed the LGBTQ+ Rights tinder interest badge and messaged me “wait, you’re a man, really?” (I am a trans woman, not a man). This was in NYC. Tinder is straight up transphobic, you need to pay people to actually monitor reports and stop banning trans people if you want to quit having such a transphobic reputation. You can’t just give a few different options to self identify gender and say you’re supportive when you constantly ban trans woman for being trans.",NotanotherDani

Now it’s nearly impossible to match with females. The algorithm is Based off payment now. If you don’t pay for Gold Plus Or Platinum. You won’t be shown in the stack or you’re at the very bottom below all the Paid users. You can swipe right all you want on females nearby, but they don’t pay for gold or platinum so they will never see you in their stack. Disappointing for all free users, even if you did pay for platinum membership you’d have a better experience. (Who would’ve guessed it) apps not worth the download anymore, people aren’t on tinder to hookup they believe it’s eharmony or match now. It is what it is, if you’re in a similar situation just go beat off and you’ll forget how depressing the app is seeing people who put social medias in their bio only to never respond and have their phone full of notifications they’ll never open like it’s a trophy.",RichmondVA2022

6 months after the right swipe (he actually super liked me lol) and I can’t believe it but I’m actually gonna say thank you to Tinder for coming through for me and bringing the most amazing, most supportive, funniest, sexiest, sweetest person into my life. I used Tinder in 3 countries for 3 years and, yes, I met absolute SCUM on this app. But I also met my favorite person on it.

Tinder,2022-01-04 03:53:30,Banned Twice For No Reason,1,"This is the support request I sent in. They haven’t responded yet, I’ll edit when they do:

I tried to login to my old tinder account. I get to the page and it says I cannot be on tinder because I don’t meet the age requirements. It said I have zero days to wait for the ban to be lifted. I am 19 years old. I cannot make a new account since my phone number is tied to this account. I tried to verify my account through the drivers License ID verification. I sent in pictures of my ID and it said to come back later and check if it has been approved. I come back later and the same screen appears- you do not meet the age requirement, you have 0 days left to wait, verify your age? 

I then decided to download an app to get another free number. The account was made but I realized I didn’t get a single swipe. I am a young, attractive lady, and when I’ve used Tinder before, I got over 200 matches within the span of an hour, each time I’ve used it. I got another subscription for this account to be able to match more and STILL no matches, no swipes, nothing. I was hidden. I tried to delete this account, and once I tried, it would always show an error when I tried to delete it. I then just paused my card/account and logged out. 

I’m nervous after seeing some of the reviews, sounds like nothing is gonna be done about it. Not getting a new iCloud so I guess the app is useless now, unless something is fixed.",briskneez

I was a paid member who one day received a message “you have been banned from tinder” without explanation. I am probably the most boring person ever, so this came as a big surprise. My best guess is that traveling for work (military service) triggered this somehow. I attempted to reach out to customer service to clear this up, but they simply referred me to a general link of their policies. I read the policies, none of which I violated. I contacted them again to explain this and fix this, but with the same result. Then I contacted them for a refund, which they refused to initiate. I had to go through my App Store and their own fraudulent charge process in order to get my money back. I provide this as a warning to other potential customers - tinder is not willing to have any customer service interactions with you. To this day, I remain banned, without explanation and nobody to appeal to.",Hittman0311
Tinder,2021-03-07 22:28:56,Not worth the time or money anymore,3,"Let me start off by saying I’ve met some interesting people through this app over an extended period of time.  Nothing that has turned into more than a friendship but a great way to meet people with like minds.  However the last few months it has become flooded with fake profiles - photos of the same guy with 20 different names, fake photos - models obviously - and men who give both first and last names - total red flags.  I do my share of reporting those I know to be fake because of previous interactions but it’s got so bad lately.  

I tried a month of Tinder gold to see if it improved but it didn’t, although European men tend to be more responsive and legit. The interesting thing is that most of these fake profiles say they are 7k+ miles away which makes you wonder if there is a Fake Tinder HQ in the middle of Africa or something.

Tinder,2023-03-10 03:25:36,☣️TOXIC!!!!☣️,1,"This app is manipulative and plays games with the male psyche. If I had to guess, this app is engineered to keep guys in limbo of REQUIRING to pay at least 25$ to get anywhere fast as far as basic matching. I swear there is an insane amount of algorithms working against you under the hood. Also seems like there are a LOT of fake profiles thrown in the mix to fluff up the loot pool, along with people from unrealistic distances. The last thing they want is a quick in-and-out 20 minute adventure here on the T. This app has tripled in complexity since I last  used it (2.5 years ago) with all sorts of new reasons to coerce you into the various subscriptions, which are all way more expensive than I remember them ever being. Tinder is designed to take your fear of loneliness and dangle it in front of your face, and  make you feel like this is the only way that you will meet someone, and that buying into it will make things happen faster. Honestly, save your time and money and just avoid this cesspool altogether!!!",Megoooooo
Tinder,2022-02-09 23:30:20,Fun but troubled,1,"I've been on and off tinder for many years and it's greatest strength is that it is indeed very easy to bump into a ton of local people and make friends/find a lover. However my experience last spring (2021) was baffling, freighting and aggravating. I had matched with 15/20 people and was very busy with work and dating someone I had met on it so was hardly on Tinder itself but maybe every couple weeks would check for messages etc. Well during this time of inactivity someone kept reporting my account every time it appeared in their stack! (Likely a spiteful ex) So naturally I open up the app one day and it announces my account has been banned. I tried to contact customer service to figure out why or what happened but was met with ""oh sorry you're just banned, there's no appeal, we take violations seriously"". Really? What violations happened from me forgetting about the app for a month and not interacting with it or any users? Like I said scary and confusing, specially in the day and age we live in",M. Spector
Tinder,2022-08-17 14:25:01,People within distance not right,3,Something is not right about the distance from people I see from my location. It’ll say someone could be like 2 miles away but there city is more like 20-25 miles away. Or 20 miles away and more like 40-70 miles away. I even seen where someone  supposedly in Chicago and I’m in California and it said 2 miles away. Um ok yeah right. And other thing literally can’t seem to do jack on this app for free other than swiping. Lucky to get one match to message. But get likes you can’t even see who it is. But after paying gold now not getting any likes whatsoever. While my buddy which is probably about the same as me as far as his looks is getting likes and matches left and right. Only difference is he doesn’t have an iPhone. And the amount of fake accounts is insane. Is tinder the ones making the fake accounts. Makes me wonder.,Kitttransam
Tinder,2023-04-10 04:04:55,This app actively discriminated against me,1,"I was removed without so much as an argument with anyone because Tinder values homophobia and bigotry. When someone has never even talked to me, they deserve no power to pass judgment. I am strong but other marginalized people would give up after experiencing this discrimination and Tinder needs to resolve it because it is pure bigotry. I do not think that I even want to return after facing so much discrimination without talking to anyone. You should never give evil people that power and honestly, you should block those people for attacking my character when they don’t know anything about me. I’m ashamed of this app and can only think of the people that have died after facing this discrimination at their hands. At the time of this writing their has been no resolution and Tinder has lied publicly on Twitter that they can restore access to the account when all their customer support did was send a threatening email, which many would describe as evil based in extreme bigotry.",anoll

Instead of paying $30, I was charged $60. Well, since I have payed for the service, I have received few likes, very few matches and my matches disappear when I try to engage in ice-breaking conversations. So I payed $60 to get less attention on this app!?!?! Also, I went through a divorce last year. I’m ready to start fresh, and I feel like this app literally creates false hope that I may find love. Which is absolutely trash to my confidence and mental health. I feel it is designed to try to hook me so when my three months are up, I will pay again for the pointless, wasteful service. DO NOT be fooled. Save your money. This app does not work as suggested. The algorithm is purposely hiding profile pics, and only showing specific available people in an area. A lawsuit should be filed against this app and developer. I think I will delete and just be single the rest of my existence.",Z1 Pinky
Tinder,2022-12-22 02:02:30,Downhill,1,"It’s a shame what’s happened to Tinder. What used to be a good way to meet people — for a hookup, a date, or even a relationship — has turned into a shameless cash grab. It has serious implications on society when one company owns all the major dating platforms that, unfortunately, are the main way an entire generation meets their romantic partners.

Ever since I got out of my last relationship, I’ve been blown away by how terrible Tinder is. I’ve tried it all: free, plus, gold, and now platinum. None of it does anything. If I get a match (which is rare), it’s somebody out of the distance preferences I set or someone I swiped on reluctantly. I’m fully convinced that the people I’d actually like to talk to just don’t see my profile at all.

I don’t know. Maybe too many people are using this now. But it’s clear that Tinder’s new ownership has prioritized selling literally useless packages to make a quick buck. In 2017, I could get a dozen matches a day for free in a small town. In a city 5X that size, I’m lucky if I get a dozen a month while paying for the ridiculously priced platinum package.

I’d say use Hinge or some other competitor, but the bad news is that they’re all owned by the same company. I hope that these apps eventually go so downhill that people are incentivized to actually talk to people at bars, parties, etc. again. Right now, this is just a playground for whoever the algorithm arbitrarily decides is attractive enough to be worth spit.",Missing the glory days

They just took my money and kicked me off. I have no idea what I did to get banned. I’m a pretty normal guy and I had no inappropriate interactions or conversations or posts on my page. I suspect my ex had something to do with it , as I have had problems with her cyber stalking me. I had to file a police report about her and everything. In any case, these guys just kicked me off, banned me and never told me why. But they sure kept my money. if they are going to take your money they could at least contact you to see if there is may be something going on. Before they ban you. It’s very shady and it’s a helpless feeling.. They just keep your money and don’t tell you anything.

Tinder,2022-05-15 03:10:21,Stay away,1,"This app is truly an evil that will destroy men and society. It completely gives all the power to women. The ratio of men to women is so skewed that it’s disgusting. There must be 100s of guys for every girl. It also constantly spams you for money and shadow bans you or doesn’t show you to matches unless you pay. Any woman you meet here is going to be beyond toxic; talking to dozens of guys picking her “winner” it promotes treating men as disposable trash. If you so much as blink wrong in her precence, she’ll pick another one from the 100s she has in the queue. You as a man mean nothing to the women here. This is such a toxic and unhealthy app that it should be made illegal. 
It sort of remind me of jim crow laws back in the day. But now its men who have to sit in the back of the bus. These apps need to implement something like women are only allowed to chat with one man at the time and when they start a new interaction the previous person is notified and deleted.

It is bad to think I paid for the developers to pretty much do nothing to keep the quality of the community.  If you want to try or is limited to just for US territory… will be much better to go for Hinge or Bumble, all of which you don’t have to pay one bucket to enjoy good quality stuff (bumble may still have some similar accounts, but way less than Tinder).

Secondly, the people looking for a third in a relationship - it’s very annoying when I’m trying to find a genuine relationship and half the men are looking for a third for their significant other I think there needs to be a option that they can click so if they are interested in that there’s a option you can click to see polyamorous couples.

At first it was great, matched with a few cute girls and was in mid convo with them then all of a sudden I’m logged out of my account and can’t log back in. Great so I make another account...but wait it’s been days and I haven’t had a single “you’ve been liked by someone get gold to see who it is”. That’s because tinder isn’t showing my profile. Why? I don’t even know. So I’m swiping on an app that won’t even give me the chance to get a match. I then deleted that account and tried to make a new one AND TINDER WONT LET ME MAKE AN ACCOUNT. I literally didn’t do anything wrong. I had only like 8 matches, I wasn’t spamming, my pictures/bio weren’t explicit, and I didn’t harass anyone.

I thought this was a liberating app where we can celebrate who we are but apparently a tiny infraction like this can shadowban you because I haven’t gotten any matches since. 

I’m also convinced tinder is manipulating its users to pay for matches because this app hardly ever shows my profile to other people. The other dating apps give me matches daily without fail and tinder used to a couple years ago when I last used tinder, but now this app is a moneysucking trash heap apparently.

I spent a whole week every day swiping right on EVERY SINGLE PERSON and did not get a single match...
They are deliberately not matching me with anyone so I will upgrade. So not only do I have to deal with advertisements and tinder promoting it’s premium package, but they are basically forcing me to upgrade if I want to even have a chance at meeting people. And at $40 dollars a month it’s absolutely a big company trying to squeeze as much $$ as they possibly can out of desperate/ lonely people, Especially now with the epidemic.

I would spend more money knowing that I could match with real people but since I have studied the patterns of your system I know exactly what your doing and it’s highly dishonest. Tinder has fake profiles that will match with you and converse with you then they will randomly unmatch with you leaving you wondering what did I say or do wrong. It’s tinder’s strategy to keep you on the app. It’s like a video game you can’t beat you will keep playing until you beat it but if you beat the game you won’t play anymore. If you meet someone off of tinder easily then tinder just lost two customers.,alex s 92
Tinder,2021-04-27 17:48:20,Profile Photos,3,"I’m not on the app much, but every so often I like to update my photos for no real reason. Since I don’t use tinder that much, I can’t really say anything bad about the app, other than than the profile photos. Specifically, my own. When I upload a photo and it takes me to the crop screen, it basically crops it for me, and doesn’t allow me to move it around at all. So my face ends up at the bottom of the screen (covered by my profile info), whenever I preview it. Also, when I upload a video and preview it, the video just doesn’t play at all. I don’t know if this is an issue specifically with the editing portion, and I’m just seeing the preview that way even though nobody else is, OR if everyone’s seeing it that way, too. That’s really the only problem I have, but it definitely makes it hard to add photos and videos to my profile.",there's no ham
Tinder,2022-10-12 22:26:32,Wrongfully Banned,2,"All right so to start off, I’ve been banned. They don’t tell you any reason besides “you’ve violated community guidelines “ and there’s no appeal process. The only thing I do on there is send my socials by clicking the button set up for that when you message somebody. I got drunk three nights ago, and ended up sending my Snapchat to about 35 matches that I’ve had sitting around for a couple weeks now. ( I know it’s a bit “lazy” or “ignorant” but I was intoxicated, but free-speech is free-speech.  It’s a clear violation of my 1st amendment right. I even passed a puzzle where you asked “pick the picture with a dinosaur in it”. It was a dino in the middle of a busy intersection as the answer. Makes no sense just like it makes no sense you banned me! Shame on you tinder, shame on you. (You also banned me 3 years ago because I had a wiener costume on for a picture which is so lame too, take a joke). But yeah, super sad to see but I’ll be back soon",quesothemonstercheeze
Tinder,2021-09-15 04:30:35,“Banned” issue,1,"Same as the majority of reviews on here, I was banned for no reason. And there’s absolutely no review process or way to ever fix it. Especially now with the newest update using your IP address and other personal information to 100% ban you so you can’t just use a new email like people used to do. I believe the banning is completely a numbers thing, and not actually ran by a group of people reviewing stuff. So hypothetically if 3-5 petty people report you for not responding, then that’s essentially viewed the same as 3-5 girls reporting some sexually aggressive guy. And that’s just not right. There should be a review process and explanation as to why you were banned and how to resolve it so us innocent people who truly weren’t disrespecting others can continue to use a platform that so many people use to interact and socialize. If you’ve been banned and haven’t written a review, please do, our voices and unjust experiences need to be heard so that hopefully Tinder makes a change eventually",Connor......

Tinder,2020-10-12 03:22:39,Horrible,1,I used tinder for a little bit and decided to take a break from it. So after a long period of time I decided I wanted to use it again so I downloaded it again when I logged on I seen that my account had been hacked and was being used by someone else. I emailed them because there is literally no other way to get a hold of someone and was told that my account was fine and it hadn’t been hacked which was obviously not true since it had none of my pictures up any more so a few weeks later I tried to get on again to do some more investigating and learned that my account had been blocked because of violations of tinders rules so I emailed them again and got back a a generic email stating that my account violated rules and they were not reversing any decisions at this time. It obviously was not looked at by any real person because I tried emailing back again and got nothing else. I’m not sure how this app can be any more horrible completely ridiculous,azang62
Tinder,2020-09-29 18:32:14,"Garbage app, even for gold",1,"This app was great for the first week or so. Then things went down hill, from 7-8 matches a day to zero actual human matches a week. The bots are rampant on this app. How hard can it be to only show verified accounts? It clearly must be out of their multi million dollar budget. As someone who paid for gold, I have seen no upside, boosts state that you become a top profile for 30 minutes, but I believe it boosts your profile one time in a 30 minute span. Pushing you further and further down the line as the time passes. I have had enough of the FAKE accounts. That is what drove me to make this review. If the creators/developers of this app even bothered to use it they could firsthand see how many robots there really are. So no I don’t think Kimberly a 24 year old person with a single photo on her account followed by 10 MORE KIMBERLYS ALSO 24 WITH ONE PHOTO. Are even remotely real. Adjust your distance from whatever it is to 10 miles and watch all the new robots appear. Say goodbye to a paying user. This App is garbage.",Mookielook
Tinder,2023-02-14 00:53:22,block suddenly and for no reason,1,"biased attitude without explanation of the reasons and the possibility of an appeal .. they just blocked it on a whim, the reasons are not known - the support simply responds with templates, they don’t even want to figure it out, a disgusting attitude with their users !!!  they position themselves as a humanity social network, but in fact they STEAL PERSONAL DATA AND SELL TO ADVERTISERS!!!  even the same Facebook, which is terrible in terms of politics, enters into a dialogue and checks the correct operation of their automatic filtering by their bot .. and tINDER think that they are the only ONE.. monopolist - but thanks to this action and the saved correspondence with support - we have already taken the case to court, and besides the inflicted  morally, they will still compensate for the wasted time. and the lost information uploaded to them ... therefore

 I recommend not to ignore their boorish attitude, but to file them with the control authorities .. they don’t want to pay support for verification, they will pay fines and compensation",ToXXuS
Tinder,2023-01-27 07:46:05,Takes advantage of good people,1,"I had purchased the gold subscription initially and got a few matches and maybe 5-7 likes.  4 Over a two month period. I wasn’t impressed so i cancelled it. All of the sudden my non-payed account blasted up to 80 likes in one week! As a reasonably good looking dude , me and all my guy friends never seen something like that within 1 weeks time so abruptly yet no matches…. Or even have likes disappear if I swiped left. I ended up cave and buy gold again, just to get 1 like since joining 3 weeks ago. This algorithm shadows bands your profile from woman and discourages the loneliest of dudes just to trick you to dish out your hard earned money. Unless you pay for platinum I’m assuming, but I’ve got no experience with that crazy expensive plan. Imagine how incredible it would be if they legitimately pushed everyone’s profile. Tinders nothing but a landfill of hopes and dreams from the the loneliest of people simply looking to be happy in this depressing society we already live in",djaisndbdhhds
Tinder,2021-11-17 11:26:20,A scam targeting vulnerable people,1,"The paid version is essentially the same as the free version so save your time, your money and your life. This is basically a psychological scam app designed to waste your time forever until you sign up for the highest level of paid subscription. tinder doesn’t put people in front of you who like your profile, instead you waste you’re one and only limited lifetime being shown people thousands of miles away instead of “local people” who have already liked you. They withhold those profiles and prevent a match to use it as leverage to encourage you to give them excessive amounts of money for the hope of a potential opportunity to meet another human being. This is my first experience using tinder and it’s disgusting to me that they manipulate people so much in such an intimate part of their lives for such intense greed. 0 star review if I could. This app feeds your insecurities and tinder exploits that to the fullest extent. Do yourself a favor and just don’t.",RainingH
Tinder,2021-10-12 20:34:52,Super Like doesn’t work,1,"I had Tinder years ago, now that I’m back it’s become even worse haha. Anyways yesterday, 11 OCT 2021, I super liked a young woman near me. I go back to look at who I’ve liked and lo and behold, her profile is not there. As of this writing, her profile is still not there. Her profile had her full name and she was very attractive. Which leads me to believe that she was catfishing. What’s worse is that I now believe that Tinder is purposely creating profiles of attractive women and as evidenced by the fact that I can’t see her profile anymore I believe that either: 1. Tinder deleted her profile immediately after I sent her a super like(which I highly doubt lol) 2. Tinder is pushing fake profiles for catfishing(which is more believable) or 3. It’s just a bug/glitch(which is also believable and what most likely happened although I don’t believe this to be the case). I have Tinder Platinum right now, but after it expires I will be deleting this app. It’s just another cash grab like most apps now.",C-dUb2020
Tinder,2020-12-22 19:56:27,Superficial & disgusting,1,"You already have stumbled upon boredom or loneliness so you download tinder. Here on this app you’ll be constantly reminded that you can actually get matches from people with real interest but only if you pay their ridiculously overpriced “service”. 
The worst part is the app must recognize who is swiped on a lot then remind you & ask you constantly “Are you sure you don’t want to super like them”. Its extremely superficial, its demoralizing & a direct insult to everyone else using tinder. They highlight specific people and push for you to continue to give just those specific people more attention.

Why wouldn’t you try to equally distribute what everyone sees and stop labeling people by their profile and asking you to “super like” them because they are half naked and have no bio? Its insulting to your users and its disgusting that the app is already this superficial but now it tells you who you should be focusing your attention on just because of what others think. Dating is individual, stop trying to give the 10’s high opportunities when others don’t always have those opportunities. I’ve spoke to a few different girls on tinder about exactly this & it a big reason they hate tinder. 

Lower the price of tinder premium services to a reasonable price- being that you can’t even guarantee that someone finds a genuine match you shouldn’t be charging more than it would cost to take someone out to dinner and a movie!!",jdubs-152

Tinder,2022-11-20 14:04:14,"Staff & algorithm targets women, Black people, and POC",1,"They either allow people to report you no reason and just attack or they have it in for Black women. Within just 2 days, I was told I had strange activity, forced to verify again twice(when there are tons of accounts unverified and I already was verified), then made me do a series of stupid tests, then locked Me out of My account for 24hrs. Then when I inquired about it, targeted Me again and removed My bio the next day claiming it was sexual. It literally isn’t. I posted about 420, games, and pizza. Mind you, there are a plethora of accounts I see where men are saying disgusting sexual things in their bios; while using vulgar language, and also posting 420. Tinder either 1. Allows weirdos to just report your account for incorrect reasons then just attacks you with no actual investigation or knowledge and/or 2. Targets Black people (I barely even see Black people or POC on this app to be honest. I hardly think it’s because these races don’t sign up.) Do better",Lesadri✨
Tinder,2021-12-01 14:04:10,Impossible,1,"Nothing has made me more frustrated or depressed than this app. Everything that could lead to a real connection is behind a paywall. Other than the app only showing me user that are substantially less attractive after I turned 30 and stopped paying for premium service. The other thing I have experimented with now that I'm 30 is the general metrics. I could swipe rite on 200 people not even bothering to look and not match with anyone but if I pay for premium services I have a externally high match rate. Not to mention after turning 30 all the premium features behind a paywall are extremely expensive and unreasonable. It’s no surprise that all these dating apps are owned by the same company so it’s a complete monopoly with no alternatives. I wish I could get my money back and the time I have wasted on this app. If you want to spend to much money to be depressed, slightly suicidal and a deep feeling of despair download tinder today, you’ll be jumping out a window in no time.",honsetabe
Tinder,2021-08-04 01:20:37,Banned for no apparent reason,1,I have had tinder for over a years time and have most likely spent 100+ in subscriptions and so forth but yet today when I go to log into the app it tells me my account has been banned and now I cannot make a new account or even be informed of what happened for myself to be banned. I contacted support in hope that it was a simple fix but as I write a long drawn out message to support I am emailed back almost immediately being told that there is nothing I can do and so once again I asked why I had been banned and that if I need to provide some sort of information to fix my account I would do so but the reply I received basically was a tinder representative telling me that there was nothing they can do for they do not offer an appeal service and with this being said I wish to have the money I spent on the app back since they do not want to help a loyal customer such as myself. Very disappointed with the folks at tinder for doing this.,platnium4snd5s
Tinder,2021-03-14 04:01:23,Really fun bug a fatal flaw,1,"I used this app for many years and met some really cool people. I was always polite and was never once reported. After the coup took place in Myanmar I felt compelled to do something, so I changed my location to Myanmar and offered in my bio to help protesters with sharing videos and organizing. After a few days my account was banned for- who knows what but I received nothing but gratitude and appreciation from my matches. It is infuriating that I could be banned for doing one of the most humane things I’ve ever done. I can understand the circumstances that would lead to an accidental ban, maybe they marked me as spam or something, but the fact that I am now banned for life without any possibility of review (you have no ban appeal) makes me want to take this to a news outlet. I know tinder got in trouble for banning BLM protesters and I don’t see how this is any different. The app overall is so great and it was super fun for so many years but it just feels so unfair to be banned FOREVER, for a mistake",Bennet Crowly
Tinder,2021-01-02 20:12:09,Tinder’s Fall From Great to Garbage,1,"I’ve used Tinder on and off over the years and have even payed for Tinder Gold in the past to get unlimited swipes as they started charging for that and was okay with it. 

After coming back to Tinder recently and paying for Gold again I have found the Gold doesn’t attribute you much AT ALL anymore. Not only is it more expensive but I’m constantly getting bombarded with pop ups asking me if I want to pay more for boost to be seen more or pay for Platinum. I used to get a pretty decent amount of matches and from all kinds of women, now I get a few here and there that are women I wouldn’t be interested in. I still have great success on BUMBLE but Tinder has turned into a complete scam, baiting you into their cheapest subscription that’s still expensive, then once you’ve done that pressuring you into paying for the most expensive one to benefit from being discoverable. Absolute dumpster fire of a scam, I’ve never tried Hinge but I hear that’s the place to be alongside Bumble. Ban me if you want, I’m done with Tinder.",LAME!!!230
Tinder,2020-12-11 16:42:16,App is ok but getting worse and worse.,2,"Seems like the developers to the app are coming up with more and more ways to try and make money off the app. I feel like the more features they add to the app, the more the free version of this app becomes useless. The new feature for “upgrading your likes” takes the purpose of super liking away and makes it sound like all the people you swipe on don’t get to see your likes. It makes it seem like a gimmick. So you could swipe for hours daily and your likes aren’t seen? Over all the app is decently structured it seems to be moving in the wrong direction to where you’re going to have to spend money to get any matches. I’d like to see the app keep its free version as exciting as the paid features without making you feel like you absolutely need to spend money to get anything out of the app. I would love to give this app a better review in the future but for now I can only give it two stars.",Dreyfus mullevart

Lol Decided to say screw it & paid for premium. Holy bot accounts. It’s soooo bad. Tinder will also randomly delete ALL of your matches or delete your account for no reason at all. This has happened to me numerous times now. Even with genuine connections before I could get her number. Thankfully we were able to move to instagram. Just because they can and you cannot dispute it. This is also my 2nd time writing a review and apparently that review is gone. Y’all, there are better dating apps. Check out Bumble & Hinge. At least in bumble, while it is a little spendy, their premium account is a one time charge for permanent access and produces genuine people. Ditch this trash app. They don’t do any sort of monitoring & you’ll just waste your time. They got me for a year, but I definitely won’t be renewing unless things drastically change.

It used to work great, function like any other basic dating/messaging app. However, for about two years now the apps most BASIC functions are constantly bugging and not working. There seems to be zero priority on making sure basic efficiency is met and maintained for the user experience. The support team literally doesn’t exist, if they do they’re hiding from people. 99% of the time you don’t get a response at all, and when you do, it’s an automated message with some unhelpful response to your query. This is getting to the point where you can’t even DELETE your own account anymore when it’s entire functionality ceases... how does that even work?

They told me at this time they can’t give me the reason. It’s ridiculous that they will not temporarily, but permanently ban you without telling you what happened. I tried to continue to reach out to them and they eventually stopped responding. Terrible customer service. There are plenty of people on this app who shouldn’t be on it. People who won’t take no for an answer, people who send inappropriate messages or pictures, people who throw insults at you when you politely reject them, you name it.

So I tried to explain that and asked the reason for the ban in which she continued to respond by saying, “Your account has been banned for violations of our Terms of Use or Community Guidelines” instead of actually communicating with me and trying to resolve the issue.

And not to mention when I try to call your “support” phone number it’s an aggressive dial tone the biggest high pitch sound I’ve ever heard before and then you have no support email, your support Twitter don’t work, your website just leads to a dead end when looking for help, you guys have no care for your customers… we just want our stuff back.. you truly need to do better this isn’t fair to all of us who did nothing wrong and are being unfairly blamed for someone else’s issues and bad behavior.

More matches; platinum, boosts and super likes and it does nothing. This is a scam warranted reporting to the Better Business Bureau . If I am shadow banned, I should be notified prior to purchasing premium services so I have a choice to spend that money knowing I will be limited to no results or value from money spent but I at least had a choice knowing I was banned.

Tinder,2021-03-06 14:44:11,App quality terrible after purchase,1,"Dang dating during Covid time is hard enough as it is. I don’t need a dating app to make dating even harder. 

Issues started arising only after I purchased a subscription. Please think twice before subscribing. Some of the issues: 

1. While I was messaging someone, they disappeared. Two days later they reappeared with one message then eventually all messages. They were wondering if we were still on for our first date since I had stopped responding.  Clearly a bug but tinder customer service just sends standard message of oh they probably unmatched you. :/

2. With other people I’ll receive notifications of a message but then there’s no message in the app. Then 8 to 24 hours later, the messages finally show up. :/

3. When I receive notifications that someone likes me about 50% of the time that’s accurate and 50% of the time there’s nothing new to see. :/

4. Based on advice from customer service I reinstalled the app. Then there was a section for messages and a feed for match updates. When I would click on some of the profiles in the feed, it would return a null result. Then I force quit the app and the feed disappeared. When I asked customer service they did not respond. :/

Tinder only provides customer service by email and I went back-and-forth with them repeatedly and continued to get form responses or responses that did not address the issues that I was raising.",Dan_746

I try not to do this often, but I’ve seen minors using the app, clearly fake accounts trying to direct me offsite, 18 year olds soliciting adults to purchase them alcohol and tobacco products, and people selling all manner of illicit substances. I report them, using the correct category, and then see them again a day or two later.

Facebook dating is completely free, you can take a second look at people you’ve swiped left on, you don’t need a subscription to see who likes you. If you have tinder delete your account and the app, if you’re thinking about downloading the app do not do it! RUN!",Joncook589
Tinder,2022-10-26 02:30:21,Banned for no reason,1,"I had a few good connections on this app and only have met a person once in real life and it was a great time! We’re still friends after 4 years. After deleting the app for a year I decided it was time to hop back on and see what’s new. All was fine for a few weeks and I even matched with a few people I liked. I was respectful and courteous to others and for no reason I had been permanently banned. I read through the guidelines and had no idea what rule I had broken since I hadn’t even met anyone else IRL in many years nor had I done anything unwarranted within the chats. The support had zero explanation for why I was banned and didn’t give me any conclusions, im upset I had made many good friends that I won’t be able to contact again. This app seems to randomly ban people and have no appeal process which seems silly cause I’ve been a member for several years. If you go through with using this app don’t expect to stay for too long.",Gordon99420
Tinder,2021-10-27 03:06:40,It’s a scam!!!,2,"What I learned from my experience is that tinder has been fully compromised by women. I’m not saying that’s it’s not fair, but that’s just what it is. I’ve been out of the dating world for a while. My friends and family were trying to warn me about the true intent of this app. Tinder is nothing more than an undercover sex app. The staff who are in control of tinder know that the dating aspect of the whole thing is non existent. There making a huge profit from men such as myself. I was wrong about the concept being a combination of dating and sex, ITS JUST SEX!!! If you are actually trying to date someone on this app, any female will think of you as a fool and laugh about it. I lost the game the moment I made the offer of taking a woman on a date with me. She knew I had no idea that the game had completely changed. Despite what I experienced, my attraction is inevitable towards woman. But I will never look at them the same ever again.",Bluedude276
Tinder,2022-05-18 03:58:50,Preferences do not match what potential matches are looking for,1,"This is one thing that has always bothered me about Tinder. If my gender says woman, and I say that I am looking for women, AND I click show me people of my orientation first (which is a cool feature) WHY am I being shown straight women?!? … I have also seen and read about this with other factors of the search, like age for example. A 50 year old man can say he is looking for 18 year old women and gets shown the entire deck even though 99.6 % of them do not say they are looking for 50 year olds! This dude will perv hundreds of profiles that these girls would not give consent to if they had the choice! …

   As a developer, I can say that it wouldn’t be that hard to match what people look for to what potential matches are looking for. Especially for a *team* of developers on such a popular app! They just don’t want that 50 year old to sign on and have only 3 profiles to swipe on because then he won’t pay any money.",Jajndjsowknsbd
Tinder,2022-02-21 10:45:02,Too much trash and no rules,1,"I have reported several really nasty sexual profiles or dirty photos several times, and they are never taken down. Which means Tinder has lazy employees, employees that can’t read, or really badly programmed bots. Which leads me to my frustration. 
I see the same guys I swipe no on over and over…and over. It doesn’t give the option to hide them or remove them. I can’t block the perverts, the married men, or the couples looking for sex. 
I can’t remove the same guys I have zero in common with. Nope, every week I have to swipe X on them again. No filters exist to remove guys with kids, smokers, or keywords like hunting, and it just wastes my time. It also keeps offering me the same three guys I reported for harassment. Thanks for making me feel unsafe Tinder! Messaging them is useless because they never answer your question; I suspect support is outsourced. 
Using Tinder is like digging through the trash looking for something good, while dodging drunks trying to assault you.",Mars7000
Tinder,2021-12-25 22:23:01,Don’t spend the time or money!,1,"Members do not have to fill out one piece of information about themselves, which makes It very difficult to find potential matches. Basics like hometown, height, kids, etc should be mandatory. Tinder also measures distance by where the user is at that time you are on. So I have many profiles that pop up within my preferred 60 miles, but two days later they live 700 miles away…because they went home! How depressing to get excited and then that happens. I upgraded to the paid version and can’t do anything I couldn’t do before. You cannot send a message to a user unless you both “like” each other, which is ridiculous. It is almost impossible to find potentials that fit into my preferences because of these reasons. If I don’t know how far they live, don’t know anything about them, and cannot reach out to them, that actually makes dating HARDER! not worth the time and money to just find disappointment all over.",Readingchik
Tinder,2021-02-28 21:37:18,"Atrociously optimized, bent on revenue",2,"The match making service is good, you can’t fault tinder for any ad accounts too much as abuse detection can only be reactionary to methods of service abuse. There’s tool that help you stay safe while enabling you to make the connections that are even more difficult in those times. 

However. The app is so terribly optimized that I MUST close and reopen the app several times during every session. Every aspect of the interface lags on my 256gb iPhone 12 Max: opening or closing a chat window, opening or closing a profile inspection, swiping on people will eventually lag and fail to recognize the full extent of the swipe gesture and cancel the action midway through. Sometimes swiping to close a chat window will render a black screen that requires the whole app to be closed because no touch action will be recognized except iOS gestures like swiping home. 

Additionally, there’s annoying functionality and messaging that pushes purchases in your face. The app can be used without upgrading for satisfactory functionality, but “pay to win” marketing impedes that standard functionality to a ridiculous degree. 

2 of the stars I’m giving you is because the free version is still a robust and useful app, so thank you for that. But minus 2 stars for the terrible performance, and minus 1 star for aggressive “pay to win” marketing impeding core functionality.",MohtasaUnique
Tinder,2021-07-06 15:25:16,Horrible customer service,1,I have never got a flag notification on tinder ever. I found my friend on tinder and we were making jokes of course. However after the day my account was blocked. I contacted tinder and got the same animated response so I responded to their email heard nothing back but received a review no questions were answered at all. I have used tinder again recently and had some really good matches however one joke between my friend that I’ve known for years with out warning gone. That’s ridiculous you need to work on your services for people to get unbanned of fix soemthing or atleast not get banned for something that wasn’t even bad. No warning nothing seems like what ever people you have moderating are just lazy and bored wanna block everything but not help them people have literaly sex in the bio however I have a genuine bio looking for someone very good messages but I get blocked from a joke that insane and I need my account fixed cause you guys made a mistake.,19494629353
Tinder,2021-05-12 01:33:15,What happened to Tinder?,1,"This app has been so glitchy for the past year and a half or so. I have matches from months ago that I never talked to suddenly appear at the front of the list, over people I JUST matched with. I have people I haven’t messaged in a long time appearing at the top of the list over people I just talked to the other day. People that I am in the middle of a conversation with will suddenly disappear from my messages and reappear in my matches section like I never talked to them. I messaged one of the women where that previous situation happened, and she swears she didn’t unmatch me or anything. This app freezes often, lags, has pop-ups that cover the keyboard and messages, and it’s just overall crappy now. I used to love using this and meeting new people with it, but it just has become too bad of an experience to deal with. Also, I have a subscription. So they get my money, just to not fix anything for over a year, and YES I have updated constantly.",floridaman2.0
Tinder,2022-01-25 22:02:22,"No customer support, app will ghost ban you",1,After reading some reviews I saw that many people had the same issue I experienced with getting ghost banned. The user agreement is fairly straightforward (basically don’t be rude or use inappropriate language) but even when using the app and following the rules all it takes is someone to report your account to get your account banned. Tinder doesn’t have a review system in place they just automatically block accounts with no appeal option. With the being said when you spend money on tinder it’s very irritating to get ghost banned and loose your matches/ money. I found tinder to be a fun app at first but it definitely makes you spend money to get any results. I used to have a tinder 6 years ago it was no where near as expensive as it is now. I would honestly recommend hinge over tinder because they have a great customer support system that will help you out if you have these types of account troubles.,Jay1994444
Tinder,2022-01-09 03:25:29,What a scam.,1,"Paid $25 for one month because it told me that I had over 2,500 likes & to upgrade to see them. Thought that would be easier than to swipe blondly through the main area. Yeah so That was an entire lie. I paid & once I went to the likes, it only allows you to see 20 likes at a time, so I went through the first 20 & then another 20 reloaded & every time - they just reload the SAME profiles that I swiped left on, except changes their profile picture to a different photo of theirs so it appears to be a different profile. They'll mix like 2-3 new profiles in there but the other 18 are always the same profiles I passed on... MULTIPLE times. I swipe left on the same profiles atleast 6 times at this point. So There are actually less than 100 likes in my 'like section' so Tinder lies & recycles the profiles that you 'pass' on & reloads them as your likes. Don't fall for the 'Upgrade to see your likes'. & Tinder - that's called scamming. Not cool.",PariAstBra
Tinder,2020-09-20 01:42:13,Crashes but good,3,"I started two days ago and have 69 likes and I’m pretty ugly so something has to be wrong with the app other than it crashing every 10 minutes on me. I’ve met some amazing girls, there is one who is really sweet, I’ll talk a little more but I am willing to drive hours to take this girl on a date sooooo. I don’t like how I can’t get unlimited likes or more than what I have for 12 hours. There no limit to love so why limit the potential for it? Paying for that stuff is just corporate bs that needs to be left behind. Let this be something good for the world not something that feeds off of it. This is an app and a website not Apple. You don’t need to make a bunch of extra features or take pre-existing ones and try and make people pay for it. Also it’d be cool to make another app for different religions. Like Tinder Christian, Tinder Islam, Tinder Judaism, etc. just an idea for y’all.",*Swag_Muffin44*
Tinder,2021-06-03 22:50:02,Blocking people,5,"I’ve used tinder for awhile. Would absolutely recommend using it as especially if you’re in a city you’re not familiar with. However one of the most annoying things about tinder is you can’t block people, so every time you see the people you had bad experiences with or missed connections with it rubs you the wrong way. The idea of having it with your number was smart. The thing is it’s not effective enough as not everyone is going to get peoples numbers they match with on tinder. If there is any way you can make it to where you can block people from seeing you and you can’t see them regardless of having their number that would be the best feature added to tinder of all time.",nfarha
Tinder,2021-01-01 04:01:50,3 main problems,1,"There are 3 main things wrong with this app 
1) at least 30-40% of the people on this app don’t know what there looking for and are using the app to try and find something els then a relationship. You also have the people that will match with you but never say anything.

2) there are people that ether blatantly or covertly advertise there onlyfans, blatantly prostituting themselves out or scamming people out of money. And the creators don’t seem to be interested in fixing problems 1 or 2. And there are ways for them to fix problems 1 and 2.

3) they come out with some new feature but puts it behind yet another pay wall. The app now has 5 things to pay for 3 of are Subscriptions. Tear 1 about 50$ a year subscribers get unlimited swipes and 5 super likes plus no adds. Tear 2 about 150 year you get everything from tear 1 plus you see who liked you before you match. Now they have a tear 3) about 200$ a year which just came out this year you get everything from tear 1 and 2 but now you can send a msg too someone after super likeing them. Then you can buy super likes and boosts. They just keep comping up with more and more ways to make you pay but never improvement on the environment.

Know even though they have Thea’s problems the app is still has its good parts it’s just a pain that you have to muddle through garbage just to find one or two people that are actually interested in dating.",Filiault
Tinder,2020-11-26 21:30:09,Do not pay for platinum,1,"I got an ad for Tinder Platinum and went ahead and bought the annual. Then, like the previous reviewer, I was banned. I’m 100 percent sure that I didn’t violate any sort of community standards. I always try to be polite, never swore, never posted fake photos, none of that. So I was really shocked. Anyway, mistakes happen. Only, there is no phone line to call. You can send them an email but there is no guarantee they’ll even responds. There is no appeals process. They don’t even tell you what caused them to do it. There’s just this death screen that says “you’ve been banned.” It’s like a Kafka novel. So I JUST paid for this annual prescription and can’t use it for reasons unknown. I don’t particularly like to communicate to the world that I’m on a dating app, but I felt i had to write this review because...what else can I do at this point ?

Perhaps I should be grateful. I was about to invest in tinder’s parent company “Match” before this experience. But I don’t want to support a company that doesn’t value its customers.",Noting Radd
Tinder,2020-11-03 04:11:19,Don’t waste your money,1,"If you want to waste/throw your money away on this then go ahead and download. People say this is “free” it ain’t, it wants to charge you for everything! and the moment you pay for something the whole app slows down, you get no matches and if you do it’s a straight scam account like the app itself. I’m not bad looking at all, and I would come on/off with this app but this time around I feel scammed and ripped off by this app. Not even their “boost” work $6.99 for 30 minutes and only 2 likes? Get out of here. And don’t accept the social distancing thing because that’s all you’re going to get, people who live 1k+ miles away and for sure....less matches. Money pit scam, don’t download this as addicting as it is.

****Update**** I came back to it and it is still the same. Boost doesn’t work. No matches for the past 5 days. And when I remade it I supposably had 7 lol this thing is ridiculous. Gotta stick through it now, I paid for a month smh lol",Stewarttt29
Tinder,2020-08-28 17:21:07,Terrible,1,I have had tinder for a couple months. I ended up matching with some man who had said many inappropriate and obscene things to me and after I was thoroughly uncomfortable he continually asked me if I was in fact 19 and at the time I was. He continued to question my age and harassed me until I logged in to unmatch with him I see that my account was banned. He later messaged me on instagram apologizing for reporting my account and begging me to forgive him. Obviously this man was very mentally unstable and had dragged me down with him. What I don’t understand is how my account was banned based on no investigation at all. I have never violated the terms and conditions and in fact of age as I am now 20 years old and have been banned for many months. Tinder has done nothing about this situation regardless of my countless emails and complaints. It’s a great app as long as you don’t match with creepy men who apparently can ruin your whole experience based on no evidence. Thoroughly disappointed at how this company handles situations like these.,emma0044
Tinder,2023-04-14 02:28:26,Paid for plus and can’t message matches?,1,"Updated review: have not tested a new paid account to see if those features actually work yet and likely never will. I know they won’t work still because I have my settings on age 24-26 and I’m getting nothing but 20-21 year olds to swipe on. Did I swipe left or right on every 24-26 year old already? In LA? Not even close to a chance that happened. Why am I being forced to swipe on the most annoying age group no matter how much I try to avoid it? I’m just gonna delete my account again and not deal with it Previous review: Can’t message my matches unless I take a dumb verification photo in the most awkward poses I’ve ever seen. UPDATE: I paid for tinder plus, made it so ppl can’t see my account, and I am still recieving likes from people ive never seen on tinder or swiped right on. So in short, you’re not getting the things they are advertising when they say pay for tinder plus or gold.

Tinder,2022-06-21 04:40:58,Too disorganized,2,"Would be a lot better if there was a way to organize messages and matches based off distance or if the messages are read or not, I miss too many connections and get overwhelmed too easily because there’s no way to organize anything on the app and then when you do get a good rhythm going the app will actually delete whole conversations and essentially reset matches. I’m only leaving a review cause I remember organizing matches based off of distance or read status being a feature they had when the app first came out and it’s something you guys over there at tinder should put back in. IMHO too much focus is being spent on floof like the discover tab or adding new features that don’t really take or work very well and not enough time is being spent on making sure the actual messaging and networking function of the app is working properly like it should be.",AdamCappello
Tinder,2022-06-08 00:19:25,😬,2,"Tinder has sort of changed into just a hookup app, everyone knows it. You don’t use Tinder now to find love, but if your trying to…good luck my friend. Apps like Hinge and bumble give the user a more descriptive profile. For instance, bumble allows the user to put what they are looking for on the app, whether it be a relationship or something casual. And like Hinge, they can add in other things like their height, religion, political views, their interests and if they smoke or drink. These apps make it easier for you to find what you are looking for and weed out the people you don’t want, versus Tinder. On Tinder I literally know nothing besides their age and what the user types on their profile. I don’t know what they’re looking for until after a long drawn out convo which could’ve been avoided. Also I don’t know their height and as a tall female, it’s important to me and it seems rude for me to message them and then ask about their height.",XxAnimElmoxX
Tinder,2021-07-28 14:06:33,Very glitchy and constant issues now,2,"Great system in theory for getting dates. But its been horribly glitchy and I have to contact support a few times a month. I get 250 likes a day, but the problem shows up when all matches get deleted randomly, people who I was very interested in. I pay for Gold, and its nice to see people who like you. But every few days matches get deleted en masse, you cant add new people to your stack, and messages dont send or get lost into oblivion despite getting notifications. Its the most effective dating and hookup app when it works. Its really sad that its so problematic now, and resolutions only happen up to a week after contacting support. Make sure if you match you give out your cell number IMMEDIATELY, as there is a high likelihood your match will disappear along with everyone else 🥺. (And no, the standard fixes dont work and its not being unmatched, Ive checked) Good luck!",Brooke Boone
Tinder,2021-04-07 19:41:09,"Swiping app, not a dating app",1,"This app is optimize to maximize swipes and matches but not conversations and actual meet ups. 
I get a dozen matches a day but literally zero conversation. I’ve tried everything from sending simple hellos to sending well-thought-out clever messages. Nothing gets a response, or maybe 1 response and then the conversation dies off. It’s so bad that there are literally businesses out there made to just “teach you what to say as an opening message” on Tinder. 
It shouldn’t be that complicated, you shouldn’t have to take a class just to be able to have a conversation with someone. 
And I used to think it’s my fault and I just don’t know how to talk to girls.... but when I tried messaging the girls I see on there on Instagram and having better luck, I realized no it’s not my issue it’s an issue with the app. 

They’ve designed the app to take your attention away from conversations to swiping, because that’s how they make their revenue.
That’s why when you first open the app they take you straight to the swiping page. They get us addicted to the process of swiping and so when get on for a couple mins we subconsciously rather swipe than talk to the ppl We’ve already matched, because it gives us more of a dopamine boost.

 If you just want entertainment this app is great but if you actually want to meet someone in the flesh, don’t waste your time.",CJvosh
Tinder,2020-11-08 02:43:22,Actually found my 1 in a million,5,"I was not a believer in tinder for the first months of using it. Honesty, data of scrolling with any matches or conversations being about as boring or unfruitful as you can get. One day however, I used a super like on a very attractive girl, expecting the same result as I normally would. A short conversation then ghosted. But after talking for a little while and finally a date, I quickly realized this girl is truly amazing and someone I quickly found feelings for. Fast forward to now and she is truly and amazing girlfriend and someone I’m planning on dating for a long time. Maybe your chances of finding someone you truly love are 1 in a million. But I ended up being that one, and if I was able to, you can find your one in a million too.",Hi2013ueuwieuie
Tinder,2020-10-29 20:37:48,Thank you tinder!,5,"Without tinder I never would’ve met my amazing girlfriend. I had never had a girlfriend before and she only had one boyfriend prior, which lasted about a month or so. Despite this, tinder made it really easy to match with a lot of different people in order to see who I wanted to pursue further. I used the free version and the 100 swipes a day was plenty for me to have a good experience with the app. All in all, when I messaged my girlfriend for the first time on tinder, I knew that we vibed just based on the responses she gave me. After snap chatting her for a few weeks I finally got the courage to hang out with her in person. From there, we’ve been together for 1 year and 4 months so far. Thank you tinder for changing my life!",HCWAYTOBE
Tinder,2022-12-28 14:40:57,Very Fun but Fleeting,1,"I went from 6 likes a year to a superuser so i think i can fairly review Tinder. 
Tinder has had a cultural impact that is unignorable. 
We use it for friends, hookups, and looking for long term dating partners. 
But it has gamified conversations and dating to a level never before seen. Those who can manipulate and adapt to the visual storytelling of the profile get hundreds if not thousands of matches, and those who can also put cute and cheeky energy into the first message and throughout the conversation can have as many partners as they want.
And therein lies the problem.
You can always have more. There is no limit to the number of men or women you can have if you know how to attract them. So when a relationship has a problem, you can just end it and move onto the next one.
This is very damaging for those who are looking to settle down, because they struggle keeping a partner who has multiple other girls/guys lined up.
Or they have to settle for someone who seems unattractive compared to all the other guys/girls theyve matched with before.
We get our ego stroked here. Even if the other person just wants us for a hookup, or imagines us as a good rebound from their last relationship, we feel a validation on the match that is a reward in itself. 

Some of my best memories were from tinder. But theyre all exes because they are all replaceable.

Maybe I’ll see you there if you’re in Hawaii 😉 I hope to be off there soon, for a good reason 👍🏻

Dating apps such as Tinder claim to have free features but in it to see who “likes” you or be able to send messages are poor advertising if they ask you to pay to see or message! Your fees are OVERRATED! There’s too many fake people and when I set my age limit between 48-59, why do I get 20 year old boys messaging me? They could be my sons friends! 🙄 also, there aren’t many men in my area. I live in Hawaii and all I’m shown are men from neighbor islands. I don’t want to be in a LDR anymore.

I don’t send nudes and I swipe right on everyone because even if we aren’t a match made in Heaven EVERYONE deserves to meet me at least once in their life. But now I don’t know how that’s going to happen because without warning or anything I was banned. This is kinda like trying to talk to your ex and see where it all went wrong because tinder doesn’t gaf just like your ex. There’s no closure here. Who knows where it all went wrong. Maybe it was me but I’m banking on it being Tinder. I am a tinder reject and I’m not sure how to feel about that. I stay awake late at night wondering what I did wrong. Am I a lost cause Tinder is that why you BANNED me?! How will I ever find someone to wed now?! 
Ok, all jokes aside: I was banned no reason as to why so I give tinder 1 star it is what it is. You may be banned for no reason at all you may meet the love of your life. Who knows. Not me. Good luck Chuck.",Iaintnojuliet12
Tinder,2021-04-03 00:33:41,RIP Tinder,1,"Want an app that ignores your desired search radius? How about one that floods you with matches from all over the world with no means to filter them out? What about one filled with scammers and bots? What if I told you that the few quality women are there to just drop their IG handle with zero intention of talking or meeting? The actual women who are there are super trashy or just a complete mess. 

Do I have your attention now? What if I sweeten the deal by saying you’ll constantly be bombarded with pitches for a paid features and told (threatened) your profile won’t be seen unless you subscribe? Wait there’s more,  these features become way more expensive as you age and become more desperate to meet people — especially during a pandemic. Want to hear the best part? This app, the biggest dating app in the world, will constantly stall or crash. 

If this sounds like your kind of party then Tinder is the place for you. I’ve used this app on and off since 2013 and I believe it is now time to say “RIP Tinder.”",Kevin C PharmD
Tinder,2023-01-21 20:03:52,Less than 1 star,1,"If I could give 0 stars.. There’s so many things wrong with this app. What really annoyed me was they deleted my account. I hadn’t logged in for a couple of weeks and decided to check it again. And they were acting like I had never created any account previously. They just deleted my account and couldn’t even be bothered to tell me they did or why they did. I will never use Tinder again and recommend you don’t either. Why waste your time on something like this.. I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re just trying to limit the amount of guys on the app or something as I definitely did not post anything wrong. What else could it be? Also, so many of the profiles I saw were for people just promoting their Instagrams. They also really encourage to pay them so you can actually be seen. Who knows what they’re doing in the background. They clearly don’t want everyone on this app. All around very disappointing experience.",Stuff everywhere
Tinder,2021-02-17 14:44:04,Tinder Review,4,"I would like to thank Tinder for allowing me to experience Tinder Passport free of charge when the pandemic began in spring. I’ve made so many friends, even close friends that I talk to daily in other countries such as Bolivia and Mexico. This is an app that allowed my to broaden my horizon and learn about new cultures and language. It allowed me to significantly improve my Spanish as well. However, there’re a few things that I hope are improved on. Such as age, I accidentally made myself a year older and cannot change it back without deleting my account and losing thousands of matches. I have tinder silver (the latest) edition and I’m glad I do get a lot of matches, but the loading time for the matches when I log in is too long. But thanks for making such a great app. Nonetheless, it’s AMAZING!",LOYAL TINDER DUUDE
Tinder,2022-11-30 23:31:27,Banned after one night,1,"So I downloaded tinder a couple days after my 18th birthday, hoping to just see what’s out there. I spent a good deal of time on it, honestly I was stressed out about the sheer number of matches I was getting. I got about 60 in that first 12 hours and I was trying to juggle different conversations and deal with horny men and whatnot. I put my phone down, head to bed, and the next day when I open tinder my account is banned for violating community guidelines. I have not done anything wrong. This was back in July and I’ve been using hinge and bumble with the same kind of conduct as I used tinder, and neither have banned me. Please fix this. Every ad that I click to the comments on has several others, mostly women, who are also banned for no reason. PLEASE fix this. There is no excuse for how unfair this is, and there is no appeals process, and nothing to say what you did wrong or when your account might be recoverable. Absolutely ridiculous.",reinavictoire
Tinder,2022-03-02 19:20:33,Glitchy App,1,"UPDATE - Nevermind. I am completely baffled by Tinder. I emailed and reported the technological errors I was encountering and 12 hours later they emailed me back notifying that my account was suddenly banned for “violating community guidelines”. I reviewed every single guideline and I had never once violated a single one. I have never once sent an inappropriate, offensive, or derogatory message. I have never once misrepresented myself. But I am suddenly banned after reporting technological errors. 

Men can get on this app and message you the most obscene and offense things and manage to keep their accounts and continue to terrorize women. But god forbid you report technological errors? 

———————————————-
Some of the reviews here are a bit confusing. It’s a bit strange to give an app a bad review for your poor dating results. 

My review stems from the sole factor of the app being SO GLITCHY! I have the worst time with this app after the past few updates.

- I’ll get notifications for messages that won’t load on the screen for DAYS. Like, no new messages will show for DAYS. When I check- the sent time will be from days prior but just show up right then. 
- I’ll get asked to “verify I’m human” and it’ll just glitch out and keep asking over and over and over until you uninstall and reinstall the app! 
- Sometimes pictures won’t upload.

It makes it super frustrating to use!",Catastrobri
Tinder,2021-09-25 18:25:48,This app is literal crap,1,"What a scam. I love how I paid for the subscription for one month because I had been getting likes and no matches. I even made miles up to 100 miles away. Anyways, after a boring few weeks of people marching and not replying, I decided to delete my account and maybe try to make a new one and see if there was any other people who would maybe talk if we had matched. But no I was banned. This app is a scam and I highly recommend actually going to places where there are people instead of using this app. I don’t understand how I constantly see threats in peoples bios but I get banned for trying to just make a new account. There’s literally people who say “I’ll stab you if you voted for trump” and these people have colored hair too but that’s fine as long as it’s hateful towards something people don’t like. Please just delete tinder off the App Store and hopefully you people can’t find a job after… good luck socializing with people!",shiptisgarbo
Tinder,2021-08-16 14:54:03,"Tinder platinum is actually $50, not $20",2,"I wish I could attach screenshots. So I was prompted for a $20 purchase for tinder plat that I bought into. Had mild successes with it. The service works as intended for me. (If you buy it, be sure to cancel auto renew so that they aren’t able to steal your money once you’re done!)

However, I come to check my purchase history and see they charged $50. $20 for tinder plat and THIRTY DOLLARS for 5 super likes a day. When they display the ad/prompt to purchase tinder plat, on the last page, it says: “includes top picks, 1 boost a month, 5 super likes a day, rewind, and passport.”

And it says TWENTY DOLLARS. Not 50. So I called apple support and reported the theft. Should be getting my refund soon for the 30. Check your purchase history! I’m sure if enough people report this to Apple, they will step in because they are literally charging over double what they’re telling apple that they’re charging.",Skyler blue
Tinder,2021-05-25 05:17:50,Banned 13 times,1,"I’ve been using tinder for almost two years now, and have been banned 13 times. It’s extremely frustrating because I have never done ANYTHING to violate the guidelines. I’m a girl so I think I haven’t had the same exposure to bots/scammers as many guys, but the problem doesn’t seem to be prevalent enough that you would ban accounts at random. 

I’ve managed to sign up multiple times by using the phone numbers of friends, but overall it is just ridiculous. I shouldn’t have to work around being banned at random, or just because a lot of guys may have reported me for not responding to their messages? That’s the only reason I can think of that someone would report me.

There are also so many accounts that are obviously fake, celebrities, underage, selling drugs/prostitution, explicit photos,” or who just message inappropriate things. Yet I am the one who gets banned? With a completely normal and appropriate profile. 

There’s no way to appeal a ban either, I’ve emailed customer service multiple times only to be denied. If tinder didn’t have such a monopoly on the college crowd I would get a different app because of the awful customer service.

Update:
My newest account lasted from October 2020 - may 2021 before being banned. There was absolute nothing I did to be banned. I can’t contact anyone about this and I’m very upset because I enjoyed tinder so much.",Elsx48
Tinder,2021-04-22 19:34:05,The Worst Dating App,1,"I was banned from Tinder. Well, I should say, Device Blocked. There was no reason given except that I violated some guidelines but it wasn’t specific and there was no way to appeal it. What it seems happened was that someone must have been offended by something in my Bio and reported me and whoever reviewed it must have agreed. Even though I never put anything offensive in my bios and I don’t post provocative photos. I’m respectful to everyone I chat with. Yet, somehow I got the boot and Tinder has no appeals process. It’s probably for the best since they charge for basically everything on the app. It’s almost like prostitution. Because most people use it to hook up and Tinder gets to profit off people paying for more views and interactions. I’ll head somewhere else that doesn’t boot you for childish reports. I will never recommend Tinder to anyone. If you’re trying to find love, don’t use Tinder. If you offend someone, expect to get Device Blocked (Cxxk/pxxxy blocked) by Tinder.",Nightmagick
Tinder,2023-01-26 17:18:26,Terrible support,2,"The app itself is decent but customer support is nonexistent. As soon as I tried to report someone with a fake profile (he kept pushing to meet, but stopped responding once I asked him to send a selfie to verify his identity), Tinder banned my own profile and locked me out until I reverified all my pictures. Even after they “unlocked” my account, my matches still had trouble messaging me and couldn’t see my replies or my profile— I only found out b/c someone who had my number reached out and asked if I was ok.

Retaliation is one thing, but the fact that Tinder is not supporting its members nor tells members why their profile is banned makes it a trash company and an app I will be deleting. I’m shocked they haven’t been sued considering some people are paying for memberships. There are too many dating apps out there and enough places to meet people in the real world to render Tinder extinct.",timewasted54322
Tinder,2021-01-18 07:20:26,Banned for no reason,1,"I rarely use the app- only once in a blue moon -but recently I opened it to find I was banned. There was nothing inappropriate about my bio or my pictures, and I rarely respond to messages. I checked their site and while it said they didn’t offer any appeals, you could email their support team about the issue. I emailed support and got a robot message back saying they didn’t take appeals. Replied again, hoping to find out at least why I was banned.  Got the same message again, though this time it had a name tag line. The lady said they couldn’t offer me any information on why my account was banned, and that I should look at their terms of service and community guidelines to figure out what I did wrong. Well I checked both throughly, and still had no idea what the issue could’ve been so I emailed her back and haven’t gotten a response. It’s been over a week now.

It doesn’t work. The problem is that the onus is not on me, the consumer, to ensure you are providing a quality product. You can’t tell me that you can’t sweep profiles for phone numbers, Instagram tags, and Snapchat links. Are you kidding me? You have created a match-making algorithm based on consumer preferences but you can’t create a crawler program to identify and ban bot accounts? Give me a break. Of course you can.

Tinder,2023-01-18 03:47:41,Money scam. They should be investigated.,1,"I’ve spent far too much on this app, and have not had few geuines matches in the process. I’m a good looking guy, and even had professional photos taken. I have swiped a like on thousands of profiles. It’s amazing how within a 15 mile radius, I can run out of matches. The next day, like magic, there are 100+ more profiles within the same radius… If you see this review, do not waste your money. This may have been good in the beginning, but over the last 3+ years, I have swiped right on thousands of profiles, and have only had a total of maybe 30 matches, most of whom never reply or send automated messages.

Edit: the last two weeks of my 6 month subscription, I noticed my “likes” going from 18, to 14, then 11, then 4. The day after my subscription ended, I all of a sudden had 21 likes again, and the second day I received another one, after the number having not changed for 5 previous months!",Hockeydemon1123

How terrible can my pictures look that not 1 person will even give me the time of day for a online conversation… it is soul crushing. 

I say not for men because my female friends do not have this problem. In fact their complaints have nothing to do with mine. They’re issue is they have too many matches, and they don’t like any of them… what a lucky problem to have. You have so many people liking you that you can’t even pick one to get with.

Tinder,2022-02-23 01:59:54,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICD,1,"I’ve been a tinder user for a couple years now, however recently I decided to delete my account to reset my matches. After creating a new account using the exact same photos as before, I closed the app without swiping on anyone. An hour or so later I found some free time and decided to get on the app. Upon open tinder I was met with a message saying that my account has been banned for violating Tinder’s policies. I was immediately confused as I had done nothing on the app, no swipes, no matches, no bio, only a few pictures all of which I had in my previous account. I emailed  customer services and was given a scripted reply telling me I had violated their policies in some way and there was no way to appeal this decision.

Tinder,2022-01-12 06:17:46,Not LGBTQ+ Friendly,1,"Despite having options to select sexual preferences, this app is 100% geared towards cis-hetero individuals. Most members of the LGBTQ+ community (including myself) end up getting banned even if the community guidelines were never violated. To make matters worse, their customer service is almost non existant. If you manage to get a response, which seems to be rare in my experience, they do not actually answer the question and use the same “copy and paste” response without even telling you what you did wrong. Even if you did violate their community guidelines, they should be able to point to specific things and be like, this is what got you banned, and hopefully people can grow from there. Instead, we get copy and paste, if anything at all. This app needs to get with the times and update their algorithm to better recognize things that are a part of queer culture and actually allow for an appeals process to get an account back.",Jfissa15

Want $200 before meeting. And.. well no, that’s not how dating works. Then while having a paid subscription. Tinder asked me to take a review survey of my satisfaction with the app. I guess they knew how I felt because when I tried to take the survey it said “ Thank you for your time. Unfortunately, you do not meet the criteria we are looking for at this time.” Why? Is that cause I won’t pay for sex? Is that why I dont meet your criteria? Screen shot was taken for posterity.

Tinder,2021-11-17 21:14:25,Banned for unexplained reasons,1,"If I could give a zero star review I would, because this platform has completely banned me without telling me why. When I went to log into my account, a screen popped up saying I was banned - which was confusing as I didn’t show nudity on my profile, racism, harassment, or any other of the reasons tinder has for being banned. When I wrote to the Tinder Help to ask why my account has been banned they told me I “broke community guidelines” and they “do not offer an appeals process at this time”. When I then asked them to elaborate on the rules that I broke they simply stated “Unfortunately we cannot provide any more detailed information at this time”. So now, I am stuck banned with no information as to why, and no way to fix it other than buying a completely new phone/phone number.

Tinder,2020-12-21 06:29:16,10 year user,1,"10 years of using Tinder in multiple states, multiple cities, I’ve met people who I became friends with, I’ve had great dates, and exciting memories, but in the year 2020 it seems that this company has taken a different route when approaching their audience on who gets banned and who doesn’t get banned. They are targeting people who aren’t in line with political values, representing femenism strongly and will ban males for disagreeing or arguing with someone’s values. Sexist and discriminatory in bans, if I reject a woman or if she doesn’t like a single thing that I say, they can report you and ban your account for life without real judgment or lawful account of the action, bans are completely biased and under no real speculation other than the fact that you’ve  been reported for something someone doesn’t like me saying, in no way have I ever been downright hateful or malicious in my actions yet I’ve been banned on my device permanently and I’m pretty sure it’s because of me standing strong in my own values.",reeldood
Tinder,2023-01-18 03:03:54,Banned with no reasoning,2,"Like several others, I was banned after about a year of steady, paid, use of the app. While I attempted to appeal the decision *twice*, or at least requested that I be given the exact violation that resulted in my ban: They wouldn’t tell me. All I got in response was a canned message that I had violated their TOS. 

This is disappointing as Tinder was actually working for me (hence the 2 stars). I met a dozen people on the app, several of which I am still friendly with —six months after my ban. While I also had some not kind interactions as well, I try not to let those color my perception. Those folks were unmatched and/or blocked easily enough. 

I will say: I was paying more than I cared for, and was ready to take a break before my ban. However, I had fully intended to come back to try again when I was in a better headspace. Oh well. Their loss. I’ll take my money elsewhere.",PQ IV
Tinder,2022-09-16 14:22:34,As buggy as an ant farm,2,"Most complaints on here are people who say they ‘didn’t do anything’ and had their account locked.
I’m upset at the fact that, up to three times a week, Tinder will completely erase my side of a conversation with a match and take them off my match list as well.
Sometimes they come back and are listed as a ‘new match’ and think I’m crazy for saying that my side of our chat disappeared.
Sometimes they just never come back at all, and not from being unmatched.  Tinder just erases matches on a whim.
Also, as a man, the ability for Tinder to control spam, bots, OnlyFans advertising and SWers on this side of the app is nonexistent.
It’s worse than Twitter.
And from 6 AM to 6 PM my card stack is almost 90% fake profiles.
When I brought this to Tinder’s attention, they changed how to report fake profiles…making it more difficult.
It is almost as though they want fake profiles.

Anyways, decent dating and hook up app, complete garbage for customer service and programming.  
This app is a dumpster fire that the developers throw fresh garbage on daily and call it ‘updates.’
Don’t bother trying to talk to anyone about anything.  They will not address the things you bring up, if they respond at all.
You’ll only get a rote response, copied and pasted from FAQs on the app.

Brace yourself. It’s a cold hard world and ghosting doesn’t only happen on Halloween. 

If you love apps that glitch out and only work 43% of the time then tinder is the place for you. Prepare yourself for the blood, sweat and tears that comes with online dating. 

Guys - Are you looking to talk to bots or subscribe to women’s onlyfans and premium snapchats? Do you love being manipulated and used for your money? If you’ve answered yes, then you’ve come to the right place. 

Women - Are you tired of paying for groceries? Swipe right on a solid 4 and never pay for your own dinner for the rest of your life. 

Looking for actual love? Thinking you swiped right on your soulmate? Think again - enjoy the side effects of tinder: crying alone at night in your bedroom while questioning your self worth, excessive drinking, checking snap scores like a paranoid psycho, staring at your phone all day praying for a text that never comes, over thinking every little thing and driving yourself insane. 

Enter at your own risk. Only the strong survive.

However after doing their stupid verification photos where you pointlessly do the poses they ask , I was brought to another stupid verification puzzle that just keep bringing me back to square one. Further more I contacted tinder seeking guidance on the situation thinking they could at least get that right . However I was met with automated like emails that lead to no where.

Just seems a bit selective and fishy to me now that Ive been researching for a bit and have seen that many women and trans people have also been unexplainably banned. Tinder is ok with outwardly stating they allow registered sex offenders to be on this app but then seem to not be willing to publically address this reoccurring problem that seems to be continuously swept under the rug... like literally I was swiping fine and pretty last night and was talking to a few men and then i open my phone this morning and see that im banned lol... like i literally read over all the guidelines and i coudlnt even think of anything I did that would have even applied to anything they had written... someone has to do something about this and please give me my account back!

If this is your way of creating more product adoption so that users have to do these task more manually, never meet people (due to the fact that they may have forgotten who they met, since we can’t “favorite” people) then I am not impressed.

Tinder,2023-03-02 18:15:51,Random Bans,1,"I thought maybe I was just one of the unlucky few who got banned for no solid reason but after reading all the reviews I’m glad to find out I’m not alone. I think it’s ridiculous that there is no appeal process or even explanation for the ban. And what’s worse is that it seems to always be a perma ban that hits you with no warning. 

I genuinely think I for the most part had cordial interactions with all of my matches. Save for one that I think just matched with me to berate me since they knew me from Highschool. The only reaaonimg I can think of was that my Tinder U verification process was a bit glitchy due to my school email being rather new. 

There’s also the problem of people using the platform to promote sexually based scams and their only fans content. While I have no problem with sex workers the fact that there are so many examples of these users preying on the vulnerability of lonely men to turn a profit is disheartening to say the least. Not to mention the blatant scammers who will give a burner Snapchat account to scam you for money off the app. 

I think the app itself is fine (still not the best but it’s the biggest so where else do you go) but this banning problem needs a solution. Even a simple reasoning behind the ban I think would help a lot of people though I believe an appeal process of some sorts would be a more complete solution.",Massive flame
Tinder,2022-12-24 03:56:27,Gets worse with every update,1,"With every update, comes more features getting locked behind a paywall, new and old features too. Unfortunately, this is the biggest dating app so you’re either stuck with not getting matches unless you pay or getting one maybe once a month (from a guys perspective). The people who run the app have very predatory practices and really try to nickel and dime every cent out of you. Previously when you ran out of likes, it would give you a timer when you’d get more. Now they took that away so you’d feel more pressured to buy the gold for unlimited likes. The notifications are also super annoying and you get a message dot from team tinder constantly tricking you into thinking you’ve got a new match when it’s just tinder trying to get you with some promotion to sign up or something.

Tinder,2022-05-11 16:18:24,Support is non-existent,1,"I used this app for 3 years with girls only as my preference and it worked just fine, I changed it to guys because as a bisexual woman I was kinda thinking… hmmm maybe I could find a sweet guy. I had it on guys for literally 2 days and someone flagged my account as fake or spam. I literally didn’t do anything. The only thing I can kinda consider is the culprit is that I used a nickname (yuumi) which is literally what my friends call me because it’s a video game reference (if you’ve played league, you know) my government name is a very unique one and I don’t want people pulling up my Facebook and messaging my dad (yes that happened before, when I first downloaded the app I had it on men and women and of course men messaged my dad telling him I was underage (I wasn’t) and that I should get off tinder) I’ve been banned for over half a year now and support couldn’t even tell me what rules I violated. Using a nickname isn’t against TOS. I just want a cute fairy gf :(",Telley :P
Tinder,2022-02-18 00:15:45,Tinder worked for me!!,5,"It’s hard to believe but thanks to Tinder I’ve found the best man ever!!! We’ve been dating for a year and a half and enjoyed every minute of it!!! We got married less than a week ago and now we are on our honey moon!!! So, we decided to spend several minutes to say thank you to Tinder and write good reviews! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!!! 
I’d been dating for a about 3 years by the time I met my perfect man. I was pretty tired of online dating cause it can be very exhausting and frustrating. But I kept looking. And first date with my future husband wasn’t perfect either. I was not into him at all. But I agreed for a second date just in case my feelings change. And they did! Now I’m so happy!!!",oksanakodirova
Tinder,2021-10-01 05:31:20,Best free hook up app,5,"If your attractive and confident this app essentially cuts out the time wasting of going to bars or clubs to meet whom ever your seeking for casual or serious dating, the later honestly being kind of hilarious here on Tinder. 
   That’s the catch, you have to be attractive for Tinder to work. It is in fact harder for men here but stick it out and there will be months where the matches are great and the time you connect with women is unforgettable, sex or not. 
    I live in a remote tourist destination so paying for Tinder is kind of worthless as there aren’t many girls to swipe on each day. However if you are attractive and you get matched without paying for the app, it’s totally worth paying for it if you live in or are in a city.",Bittersnowwd
Tinder,2021-09-05 23:31:04,Making more options may help,5,"I know the basis of this app, while unintended is hookups. I feel like it’s starting to get really dull on Tinder and people tend to delete it right after they graduate college. It would be great if there were option in the app for if you’re looking for friends, a casual relationship, or serious dating. I won’t tell you how much that would help people get to know each other more, but it would definitely get more people downloading the app and less deleting it.

I’ve had this app since I started college and now I’m in grad school. It’s earned me a lot of friends but it can also be weird to match with someone and not know their intentions. Just something to think about.",MoscatoMoMo
Tinder,2021-05-18 21:15:37,Banned for no reason,1,"I’ve used tinder off and on for years and had no issues until I got banned last night for no reason. I meet all the “community guidelines,” no inappropriate photos, I don’t harass people, I actually hadn’t had a conversation in two days when this happened. I emailed support and got an automated message saying that my account will remain banned for life. 
It’s kind of hilarious when you realize how many bots, sex workers, and harassers there are on these sites , but they’ll delete random people, myself and others, who have even paid for this god forsaken site multiple times. Lol. Tinder is a joke.
It’s also laggy and horribly overpriced if you ever want to pay to see your likes. I have only paid during major sales ($14).
If you have hundreds of likes but only a few dozen matches, pro tip is NOT to pay because all the likes are just the people you’re swiping left on or tinder bot likes to entice you to pay!",CcLH19
Tinder,2021-04-27 12:43:37,Completely Unusable,1,"So I’ve had this app for like six or seven years. I have just over 700 matches and have gone on maybe three or four tinder dates. One of them I even dated for a little while, but statistically you are not even going to get a message or reply from about 90% of your matches. 
But that’s not what my review is about- it’s about the fact that the app has become completely unusable. Not unbearable- unusable. It lags, crashes, no longer allows me to search my matches, completely shifts around my chat and match orders over and over while I’m just looking at the screen. These are some SERIOUS bugs and if I were still paying for tinder gold I would be livid. 
Get it together with these bugs ASAP. 
Moreover, the app lacks any and all engagement between matches. I cannot see any activity or profile changes from my matches, so if we don’t message right away it’s as if they never really existed. The developers really need to work on creating engagement, even after matching. The “Swipe Night” thing was entertaining, but kind of a burp on a road to interesting developments. 

Bottom line- app does not even function at its basic level because of all the glitches. 
There is a MAJOR lack of engagement between matches that doesn’t keep me interested in the app and doesn’t help me to explore old matches who are still single and in my city.",AnthonyGotaDonk
Tinder,2020-11-24 03:07:33,Doesn’t make sense,1,"I’ll stars by saying, the first time I opened a tinder account, I had 100+ likes and made many matches with beautiful girls. I had to pay to view who liked me and to have super likes which seems the easiest way to get matches with girls you like. But in reality I didn’t had any good conversations with any of the girls . They seem uninterested on having a real conversation and getting to know you, it really feels like they are on tinder to boost their ego and get more followers on instagram and sc. Everytime I open an account again it seems it’s getting worst. I barely get likes and any matches even using super likes (gold membership) which doesn’t make any sense to me, because (humbly) I am really good looking guy, with good pics and a good bio. Every time i go out to nightclubs or bars women stare at me. I am good looking guy, successful, athletic with a good personality and I can’t get any matches . Something doesn’t add up to me. Waste of time and money. Better go out and meet girls on the street!",jaxteller11
Tinder,2022-06-14 19:43:02,Faulty verification,1,I used this app in the past before with no issues especially on being verified and I decided to use this app once again it said this time my account was getting to much attention next time I logged back in I was already going to sleep and was asked to please verify my account it normally never forcefully asked me to verify but I decided to just do it while I was laying down since I was tired once I go back on the app in the morning it says im permanently banned this has never happened before and I’ve usually always verified my account in the past and probably with better lighting I’d be able to verify myself easier but I am upset that I’m wrongfully banned and this is a very terrible design at worst they should have given me an extra opportunity to verify myself I don’t get why it’s suddenly so strict on verification it has never done this for me in the past I am very upset and wish to have my account back.,Anthony aguila
Tinder,2022-05-11 21:57:28,Banned for no reason,1,"I was like any normal person on tinder, just trying to find someone who I could end up dating. I had the app for about two months, until I got banned for absolutely no reason or explanation. I can only assume I got reported by one of my ex girlfriends who hate me who I saw on the app just two days before the ban happened. The face that I get no reason behind why and that I can’t make a new account EVER is ridiculous. I know for a fact I didn’t break any of their rules whatsoever. I read them very 
thoroughly after it happened. I cant get ahold of anybody from the tinder support which makes me think there is no support whatsoever. If this is how they treat paying customers I would highly suggest getting bumble instead. I’ve used bumble off and on for years with no problems, which I believe makes it a far superior dating app than tinder. I would honestly give this app a 0 star but unfortunately that’s not an option.",Msnsndjdjgxxh
Tinder,2021-11-06 22:26:03,No match for you,1,"Please respond to this:
This is the third time this has happened to me: I match with a girl we are having a conversation then I got unmatched in the middle of the conversation, there was no indication that the conversation was going south. So I just brushed it off and continued swiping. A few days later the match appeared on my queue again and tried to apologize for what happened but at this point they really are mad at me now and I lost my chance which made me come to the conclusion that the app is un matching me. At first I thought it was her the second time maybe something happened. But now it happened again and I am just waiting for the match to pop up again and this time they will genuinely be mad at me and not reply. Please let us decide if we want to pursue that person rather than deciding for us. 
Also yes there are a lot of prostitutes and potheads that pop up and bots that want to get me to send them money. Please fix this.",Holyangemon7401
Tinder,2021-08-29 23:01:17,Tired of seeing the same people,2,"Y’all really need to do something about the fact that no matter how many times you swipe left on someone, if they swipe right on you, you keep seeing them on your feed. I feel like after you’ve swiped left on somebody multiple times you shouldn’t see them anymore. I spend so much time reporting people I’ve swiped left on several times as ‘I’m not interested in this person’ it makes me not even want to use the app anymore, it’s so annoying! And I know that some of it is because of ppl deleting their profile and then coming back, but it happens WAY too much to just be that. But even if ppl do delete their profile, if they make a new one using the same info, my account should still remember that I swiped left on that person based on their account info (email and phone number) and not show them in my feed.",........nah.
Tinder,2021-02-23 04:43:19,Just give it time!,4,"I’ve used this app for a little under a year and I’ve had MANY ups and downs with the people on there, to the point where I would delete it multiple times because I got tired of it. But then I realized that I was the problem, with these kind of apps, you need to go in with the mindset of no expectations. I didn’t pay for any subscriptions either because I didn’t want that pressure. True that there are bots/weirdos and etc, but VS the majority, it doesn’t really make a difference. I became good friends with this super sweet guy, we had a platonic friendship for about half a year and now things have become romantic :) without this app, I would’ve never met my best friend and my future boyfriend!

But as I have used this app many times with no problems, I would have appreciated a warning if they were looking to ban my account so I could either fix any problem with my profile or on their end. I was on the site for maybe a day or two without talking to anyone when I was banned. I then turned to their services and found they are taking no ban pleas, and on top of that the only email I could find stated that you should never send a email containing a customer service problem to this email. So I’m left with no explanation and no where to turn. As I hear this is a reoccurring problem I will be likely to switch to another platform unless they can help me fix this issue. I am happy to comply to their rules and regulations but I am very disappointed in their lack of communication and customer service.",brie.bearb
Tinder,2021-07-22 15:21:46,Pleasantly Shocked,4,"Historically I have had pretty bad luck on this app and dating apps in general. Either with meeting total creeps or just struggling to find people I connected with. Just like everybody else I would download and delete the app over and over and go on dates and get discouraged. But right when I was about to give up and delete Tinder again I met the absolute most amazing human I have ever met and we are celebrating our six month anniversary next week. My younger brother also met his significant other on Tinder and they are coming up on a year and a half now and just moved in together. So for anyone as skeptical as I was, it can work. It might just take a little while and a lot of luck. But there are good people out there and some of them apparently use Tinder :P",Merg65836483
Tinder,2021-02-09 16:45:14,No new matches,1,"I have been an avid user of tinder and purchased “tinder platinum”. As of recently I’ve been experiencing a lot of technical issues with the app(this isn’t uncommon, the app has many crashes and glitches). As of now I’m unable to procure any new matches. I’ve been swiping and normally get matches easily, although lately I have yet to see one. Thinking nothing of it. I go into in my likes to see people who have previously “liked” me and can be an easy match. I go on to like someone and my match will only appear for 1-2 seconds before I receive a message on the screen “error failed to match with BLANK”. This has been going on for a while now and there’s no way to contact anyone for support besides through their FAX number. Nevertheless I’m a little disappointed spending money for something I can’t even properly use. I would recommend only getting the free account and to have fun with it while you can.",honestyfirst😁
Tinder,2020-10-16 05:13:59,Fed up,1,"I’ve used Tinder on and off for years. I’ve never been so frustrated with this app till now. 
Things were smooth, I had multiple conversations going, I’d swipe right and no problem if it was a match it would show up. Tinder worked just fine. But then it was like a switch went off. No more messages, I’d swipe on people and nothing(fine figured I hadn’t matched anyone), I swiped on someone who super liked me and nothing, they didn’t show up under new matches, nothing!! 
I tried deleting the app, I tried deleting it and restarting my phone and downloading it again, I tried logging in differently, nothing worked. So I wrote tinder per their very horrible customer support options and received a “Request received help/support” email. I've yet to hear anything. So again I proceeded to do everything above and still nothing. 
Now I’m annoyed so I try to delete my account so I can just start over. I get to the prompt to delete my account and I CANT EVEN DELETE MY ACCOUNT !!",Chey316
Tinder,2022-10-07 23:33:19,Wow,1,At least with Grindr you can appeal bans and they sort of tell you why sometimes you were banned maybe you posted something you shouldn’t etc or if they made a mistake they will unban you but with this company they don’t tell you anything and you can’t appeal it and to be honest Grindr use to ban for no reason but now most times you have to do something they will look into it but tinder does not care they take your money and run … it’s a scam for sure the automated system ban is lazy and they don’t want to pay people to work to fix this ban issue so Everyone gets banned even if someone reports you because you look good or you not into them or the sex or whatever the reason … this has got to be one of the worse apps and it’s sad gay people have to deal with this mess to be honest I suggest you do not pay for this app and read reviews and you will see most of them are bad and for the life of love please do not pay for this app,Cas88cas
Tinder,2022-05-08 18:58:48,This app is a cash grab,1,Ridiculous 30-40 dollar monthly prices for the chance of meeting someone who 85% of the time will end with stop texting. Not sure how many fake accounts are in this app either but I have been scrolling long enough to find a few. 7-8 dollars for one measly boost. Super boosted are insanely overpriced with the minimum time being three hours. I boosted on a Sunday and spent 7 dollars on it and got 3 matches. One match was from an account that “no longer existed.” I’ve had a lot more luck on Bumble and POF. I am talking with a few people but they text once then spend 1-3 days to reply. Very suspicious. I’m not even bad looking. People generally say I’m an attractive guy with a good personality. (Not to toot my own horn sorry). Overall I feel this app doesn’t care at all for its users and only cares about how high they charge there users and still get away with it. Just because it’s a well known app doesn’t mean it’s good. Stay away.,Atown1667

Tinder,2021-02-07 18:25:02,Banned for No Good Reason,1,"I have been using the app for about 4 years. It’s great for meeting new people when you move and I’ve gone on a few dates as well. However, I recently got banned without warning, I looked up this issue and apparently 20% of men get banned from tinder and it’s only been more strict over time. 
When I contacted tinder asking to know why I was banned and if I could appeal, they sent me a copy and pasted message of “we take our community very seriously, please read our user terms of services to know why” over and over.
It’s very annoying in this day and age during a pandemic to be banned from one of the only safe ways of meeting people with no explanation, especially since I think my banning was a mistake. I try to be very respectful to people online and after reading the terms, I don’t feel like I seriously broke any of them. It’s very unprofessional for a company to run their costumer services with just copy and pasted responses it feels very disingenuous.",Banshshahsmsbgz

I am in college and of legal age. had a verified account, pictures, linked Instagram, filled out bio, and stats. I am not into hookups, and I do not partake in illegal activities. It is so disgusting the amount of fake accounts or illegal accounts that are on the app, but when an individual actually needs an outlet like this, they are banned. I reached out to the company and asked for insight as to how I was banned, and I was told that I was banned and wouldn’t be allowed to use the app again. They never answered my actual question and the response seemed automated. I was highly disappointed to have put so much effort into something that ultimately got taken away from me. Take it from me and the 10 most recent reviews on here, because clearly they are having an issue with censoring accounts. The lack of reasoning is highly distasteful. Don’t waste your time on this app, it’s a scam and disappointment.",Monkey525
Tinder,2020-10-18 21:21:49,Terrible Customer Service,1,"From what I’ve been reading, Tinder bans people left and right without giving them an explanation. That which happened to me too. I had been chatting with these two guys on there and we were having an awesome conversation that when I open the app back to reply to one of them, I get logged out. After I try to log in, I get the “You’ve been Banned” notification. I reached out to Customer Service to get my account back or at least some insight on my account getting banned but they keep sending out the same generic email out, as well as the reply they send after I messaged them back. I’ve already read the Terms of Use and Community Guidelines and they seem a bit extreme for what one can possibly do on their app to get banned. After reading both of those pages at least three times, I still couldn’t find a single reason as to why I would be getting banned.  It’s such a shame that Tinder bans people without an explanation.",Aerocalypto
Tinder,2023-02-10 01:20:10,Tinder banned me for no reason one week after i had bought a subscription.,1,I have had tinder for a while but my matches get jumbled because of just the amount of them and how much i travel so i decided to reset it so i can start fresh with my matches. I did this and ended up buying a 6 month subscription. One week after i do all of this things are going well then bam i got like 15 matches in total then got banned for zero reason. I have since emailed the support email multiple times but just receive a copy and paste answer to refer to the terms and conditions. Ive done this and i have not violated any of these rules seeing as it was a fresh account. This seems like a bad business practice seeing as i had just subscribed. Meaning you would have made more money off of me in the next 6 months. It's ridiculous that there isn't an actual appeal process or any actual resolution for this mistake on their part. Bad app.,richard_eugenee
Tinder,2023-02-06 00:39:20,They shadowban,1,"They shadowban. It's also filled with bots and ugly, fat women. My advice for a guy reading this; buy a flashlight. Tinder is only worth using if you're rich, got a mansion and a boat so you'll certainly meet women on here but if you're a guy that has all that I don't know why you would need tinder anyway? But the quality is just degraded so much. App was way better years back. Now they force an agenda, just like any other company. But the app itself has so much clutter and unnecessary addons. The biggest issue is how they shadowban so you cant get any matches or just ban your cell phone number. Eventually you run out of numbers and can't ever sign up. Even if you get a different number they shadowban IP or payment method. I think this is a way for tinder to keep off certain people off the app forever. They've made their money so now it's onto the agenda thing, regardless if they lose money and permanently remove customers.",deez big ahh nutz

I asked them for information as to a reason and to speak with someone who can resolve the issue, and got another scripted reply referring to their documents. I am now trying to take legal action against them and urge anyone who has had their account banned to have a lawyer contact them regarding your account. At the very least reach out and organize.

Tinder,2022-11-30 19:33:01,Pretty close to a scam,1,So in the first 24-48 hours you’ll get enough likes to make you want to sign up. About 70% of those will be real people. After this period you’ll only see people 50+ miles or more away from you so the app suggests you increase the mileage - because sure we all want to meet people that live a few hours away - and also increase the age range. This will of course bring more people into the fold but it will be a rarity you see someone real within your desired distance range. I suspect the same occurs to women but it seems the goal is to get men to sign up and just keep suckering them in. I got the Gold membership so I could see the likes and one seemed real until she suggested I find her on “allonew com” which I searched for and it’s Ashley Madison lol so sure I’ll go pay money to look for you there even though I’ve already connected with you here! 😂 Lol I’ve no problem paying but my message is buyer beware!,Stella Rachel
Tinder,2022-05-05 12:18:06,Not consistent and Gold subscription is a scam,1,"I’ve deleted and created new account multiple times. Each time there are inconsistencies when it come to the number of matches and actually finding out who liked you. I bought gold thinking this will fix the issue since it promotes being able to have super likes, boost (which should increase matches), and other things. Well, when I bought gold I rarely received any matches or when I did receive a notification that someone liked me and I opened it to view it, a pop up will show up and say “no one at this time liked you, please go to discovery and swipe”. 

This app and this subscription has flaws and inconsistencies that need to be addressed. I have been using tinder on/off since college. In my option this app has changed so much, and the majority of the change has not been good. A lot of money grabbing from the developers and misleading marketing.",cedarwood27

Platinum literally just gives you some super likes (emphasis on the some) and quote on quote “prioritizes your likes”. This is quite false. I know many people who had Platinum and there luck wasn’t good at all either. The price is just not worth it. You shouldn’t have to pay so much to have boosts as well. I feel like if you buy Gold you should have as many boosts as you want. We are paying for this service. Not too mention its nothing but scammers now too.

Obviously, most of the matches are still fake profiles or scam profiles. That’s fine, I wasn’t too mad about that.

Finally, I was seeing real people but that only lasted 12 hours until my account was banned! I made a detail response when I deleted my account explaining that the reason for me deleting it was the influx of fake profiles on my feed.

Not sure what that was because I’ve never said anything derogatory toward anyone or photos. After emailing them I got the typical response of blah blah blah thanks for your money there’s nothing we can do here and that was that.

Tinder,2021-11-07 16:01:57,Not a “Dating” app,3,"Tinder is, essentially, just an app for one-night stands. That may sound obvious, but to me it wasn’t (initially).

I have met people off of Tinder before for actual dates before, but most of what I have found is: 

1. People trying to advertise their OnlyFans.
2. People trying to sell nudes (or feet pics).
3. Bots
4. People looking for a plug.
5. People looking for a sugar daddy.

If you’re looking for a relationship (or anyone who isn’t after your money only), you’d be better off using a different app. This app may have been developed, originally, for dating but that’s not what it’s used for now.

For me, this app made it difficult to have and to keep a relationship as I would think of the girls that I could be with via Tinder. Psychologically speaking, there are three things that make you stay in a relationship:
1. Investment into that relationship
2. *Availability of other people*
3. Time in that relationship
Availability is, typically, the most difficult. However, dating apps (and hookup apps, like Tinder) make you feel as though there is a million different people out there, all at your fingertips. They might be, or they might not. It can mess with your head though.

TLDR: Tinder bad for dating, good for hookups, overall: meh.",Covert to
Tinder,2023-03-27 22:16:27,WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,1,"Tinder is a wasteland of crappy profiles, rife with stale ideas, and tries to bilk you out of every penny they can without producing any results at all. Sure, pay for Tinder “Platinum”; sounds fancy, right? Guess what… it’s useless. Ok, you can see who’s liked you, but when you do, you just don’t care because they’re either 8000+ miles away or just not anyone you’d ever consider a match. MAYBE 1 out of 1000 is a possible match, if that. Oh, you thought your profile got priority treatment when you paid for “Platinum”? Sorry, guess again; that costs extra. I guess it’s fake platinum. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY WITH THIS WASTELAND OF A DATING APP. EVERYTHING the Match Group touches has zero desire to actually help you match and every desire to make money off of your loneliness. EVERYTHING. An oh, “Global”? THE ABSOLUTELY WORST IDEA TO HAPPEN TO APP DATING, EVER. What a huge annoyance that YOU CANNOT TURN OFF. Why are people that are 8,000+ miles away from me liking my profile? WHY?!",mschultz
Tinder,2022-12-18 12:06:06,Not what it once was!!!,1,"The app has changed over the years for the worst. Just like any business they have pushed harder and harder to create larger profits but without adding any value to the app itself. Also there is the shadow banning aspect instead of tinder banning you from the app all together, They will put a shadow ban on your account where you are invisible to others. It will not tell you this has happened instead you will just continue to spend money with no results, and no clue that this is going on ( stealing if you ask me). If you are shadow banned from my understanding it’s not as simple as just creating a new account. You cannot use the same Phone number, Apple ID, or Facebook. Also could be linked to your IP address. So probably not worth the headache go out be social meet people the normal way it is much safer than tinder in my opinion and you will have to meet the person eventually anyway right?",BigLick3021
Tinder,2022-07-01 11:17:49,Banned with no explanation.,1,"I was banned completely out of the blue without any reason giving besides “violating guidelines.” I’m assuming someone I accidentally left on read reported me for something random. I’d only messaged a few people the last mount and it was to give them my social media since I’m not active enough on tinder. But instead of looking into it, tinder just banned my account and banned me from making any accounts in the future. The instructions said to unsubscribe and delete. I contacted support because I had already paid for premium for a year and had only had the app a few months. I sent them my ID in case someone reported me as underage, stated I did not violate the guidelines and wanted proof or my money or account back. I got an automated response saying I violated guidelines- again, no specifics - and that there was no appeal process. My account is banned and the money I spent on it is wasted. Great customer service🙄",TesseyTess2
Tinder,2021-02-26 21:49:36,Discovery doesn’t work,3,"How many times do I have to swipe left and right on the same people? I’m like, IN LOVE with this one woman, but I’ve swiped right on her literally over a dozen times. I see the same people over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over. I’ve had this app for over a week and not a single match. Probably because my app isn’t recognizing I’m actually swiping on people, because I keep seeing them over and over and.... you get the point. I’ve emailed “support”, and haven’t heard anything back. Reading other reviews I understand why. Fix your app! To the consumers, do NOT spend money until they fix it!",Kenny Mellan
Tinder,2021-08-04 21:47:59,"Banned for no reason, like everyone else",1,"For context, I’m a cisgender female. I feel that my account on Tinder was banned for no reason. I never even got a warning email saying my account was under review; I was on the app this morning and everything was fine, but when I tried to log on in the afternoon it said my account had been banned. I went through all the terms of service and community guidelines and cannot find any violation I may have committed. I have always been respectful towards my matches and cannot think of anything I could have done wrong. I’ve been searching online for reasons I might have been banned and I really think it was due to unfair “revenge reporting” from matches who were angry that I didn’t respond fast enough. I’m very dismayed - I’ve been on the receiving end of several inappropriate messages and just unmatched/ignored them; all I wanted was to just find a boyfriend but I guess I can’t do that anymore.",andy.m4a
Tinder,2021-07-03 06:30:32,Need to weed out some of their users,1,"Tinder needs to weeds out some people. I don’t think it should be an app for anything, it should be just for dating. I meet way to many people who don’t want to date and just want to be friends. Either get them out or add a filter option were you can select two catagories. Friends/casual and short/long term relationship. It’ll help have friends find friends and daters find daters. 

I have also seen some other reviews and I would also like to add onto them. They should hide the card of the user if they repeatedly do not get on tinder AND do not talk to almost all the people who they match with. That way people who aren’t REALLY on tinder won’t be shown to be on tinder. It’ll these suggestion will help people find what their looking for and also not have the deal with non-committed people who “got tinder as a joke”

Really good app, have had success, but should tweaked in some areas as listed above.",WP_William
Tinder,2020-09-26 17:41:55,Account banned,1,"I recently had my account banned I believe when I was attempting to verify myself with the 2 selfies. In my profile I had 2 pictures wearing a hat and in the verification photos, I did not have one on. I would not deliberately try to be someone else while trying to verify. I’m never vulgar or inappropriate and treat all my matches with respect. I can imagine how scary it can be on tinder, as a woman especially. I just want to give them a better sense of comfortability that I am who I say I am. Obviously the dating scene is harder now that people aren’t really partaking in any social events so I do enjoy meeting people on Tinder. There are plenty of people on there who do not deserve to be. From prostitutes, to people selling products/services to straight up catfishes. I do not fall in any of these categories and never have. Has anyone else had any luck contacting tinder? My efforts trying to contact customer support seem to be pointless.",aaronwLong
Tinder,2022-03-10 02:05:16,Banned for re-joining?,1,"So I used tinder periodically but when I met someone I clicked with I would close my account and delete the app. Recently downloaded it again and tried to sign in to make sure that I didn’t still have any accounts up before signing up brand new. Then a day later I open up the app to find that I’m banned, after reviewing the terms of service, the only thing I can think I’ve been banned for is their policy on multiple accounts? They didn’t tell the reason for the banning. I tried to contact the help desk via email but they gave me a pre-typed fish food reply that seems like they just forward to everyone. I’ve deleted the app now completely, I’m a bit disappointed but there are other dating apps so I’m not really that upset. But just a warning to anyone, if you use this to date and delete after you’ve met someone, they won’t let you come back if that didn’t work out🤷🏽‍♀️",Yxycuvkb
Tinder,2021-10-29 10:43:41,Banned for no reason,1,"I had a tinder account back in July of 2021 but I deleted it cuz I found someone at the time. Just as of a yesterday I tried making an account and I come to find out I’ve been banned. How could I possibly do anything to be banned if my account was deleted by me manually?? Even when my account was active I never harassed anyone, used inappropriate pictures, wrote anything offensive in my bio, I’m not underage and I’m not going around catfishing people so I don’t get it. I tried emailing them and someone by the name of Harley got back with me late last night and said I was banned for violating terms of service but wouldn’t tell me what exactly so pretty much I’m permanently banned not knowing why, if I want to use this app again I’d have to use a different phone number which is ridiculous so my advice for everyone is don’t waste your time with this rubbish app you gotta pay to get all the decent features anyways.",Anonymous74629
Tinder,2021-09-18 17:27:17,Wild rollercoaster,5,"Tinder is a great app if you’re looking to match with someone and then probably never talk to them again, but there will be that one girl you meet on there that you truly connect with and share everything in common with. That experience alone is insane, to find someone that is like you in some many ways yet you’ve never met them until now. Tinder helped me meet my beautiful girlfriend and for the last 9 months we’ve been together. These last 9 months have been the best ever. Truly you never know whose out there just waiting to make your life amazing. I met someone I want to spend the rest of my life with and that’s all because of Tinder. Thank you devs at Tinder!!",Joe Zora
Tinder,2021-01-08 00:32:05,This app is insulting to older users,1,"As I was sitting, doing nothing, I received a notification telling me that my procrastination was epic.  I’m sorry that my life is busy and I don’t have time to swipe left or right on YOUR whim, Tinder.

I literally felt more insulted by this one notification than I have in my life.  Why on earth would I continue to use an app that insults me for being busy and not following what they consider to be a regular schedule?  The fact that they think this is an acceptable way to treat a paying customer is absolutely deplorable.  If I went to a physical store, or even an online retailer, and they told me how I was wrong or lazy for not shopping with them more frequently, I would let the world know how how wrong they were.  Just because Tinder is an online dating platform does not give them the right to insult me.  I recommend everyone stay away.  No one deserves to be insulted because they have a busy life or can’t invest their time swiping on Tinder’s timeline.",Vharaek
Tinder,2020-11-20 21:50:42,Please stay away from this. It’s a joke.,1,"First I’m not going to discredit everyone on this app because I know a few people personally who have use the app and whoever found success but there are a few in 1 million that are actually genuine people on this thing. So good for the ones you do find it but for the others I wouldn’t even waste my time.

I’m going to tell you this right now, not the best site’/app you should be on. Listen to what I’m saying. I’ve been on this app for about three years I’ve only been lied to, scammed and cheated out of meeting someone and chasing someone and also losing a ton of money. 

I am one of those gullible people but also I’m one of those genuine people who really just want to meet someone. Tinder is the equivalent to a dumpster that belongs to a sex factory that on fire. Please just go out there and explore. You are wasting your time, money and effort that could be invested into a real relationship.",Jagermister19
Tinder,2023-04-17 08:17:36,Stay dating,1,"Ever since this app tried to be like every other social media app the whole dating part of it basically was ruined, I used to talk to a good amount of girls on tinder and each time it would be about going on a date or seeing if we click by hanging out but now every single girl wants to have friends now on tinder, of all places to meet friends you pick a dating app I more hate this app now because of them just trying to be like every other app and loosing what the app was all about in the first place, a dating app not social media stay what you are folks since now I'm considering just deleting the app
Update 3 years later and it’s somehow even worse
Whoever thinks this app is for making friends go on an app like meet me or something you know… meant for friends and not a dating app… like how out of touch/dense can you be to use a dating app to ONLY make friends… you look stupid and like a joke",Potao357
Tinder,2022-07-28 01:00:12,"Banned, no information provided.",1,"Previously had used tinder in 2019, found a serious friendship/relationship for a while until she relocated out of the US. 
Here in 2022 I just relocated myself, got a local number… I’ve taken time to heal myself and was finally ready to start dating seriously again. 

So I recently had downloaded Tinder and created an account. 
I swiped maybe one or two times a week.. 
Less than a month after creating my account has been banned, “the decision is final”. 

Reached out to them, request the why’s and what I didn’t wrong.. they state it appears I successfully deleted my account… (I’M BANNED?) They said there is no account with my email.. I provided them my number associated with the account… 

Long message shot…. (Thanks for following up, sorry we couldn’t be of more assistance…This is all the assistance we can provide?) 

🤷‍♂️ I’ve been banned on other apps because I shoot quality photos with my camera, and someone reported me for “commercial use” “copywrite” every time these other apps have resolved my issue, Tinder.. didn’t attempt to do a thing. Bumble has better customer service, Elly, and Harley… on the two am are just riding the clock. 

HERE I COME BUMBLE. 💯 I see other reviews also have had this same issue recently with tinder..  Bye tinder, you’re becoming obsolete at your own doing. 🤣",I'mReal..BadReview4U
Tinder,2022-04-06 22:57:39,Gets worse with each update,1,"I used to have zero problems with this app and had plenty of success on it. Now I have to log out and log back in to even do things as basic as see the message I was notified about. My matches can go from 2,000+ down to 60 then back to 2000+ in between all of those logins. Matches appear and disappear along with chats/messages, chats from months or even years ago are suddenly moved to the top of the chat feed while the most recent ones move to the very bottom. 

Much of what used to be basic functions available to all users is now placed behind a paywall. Just to provide one example if memory serves, you used to get five free super-likes a day now you have to pay to even get one; I refuse to pump money into any of these dating apps both on principle and because who on earth would trust them with their payment info when their app is this much of a glitchy mess?",Sssssseeeeeeetttthhh
Tinder,2021-06-27 18:54:20,Too many glitches,1,"I deleted this app because it has a lot of bugs, it freezes often and will just shut down, I’ve emailed customer support ( since they don’t have a number to call) and never get a response. So I emailed again asking for a refund for my gold membership since the app was not working and I couldn’t use it, instead of someone contacting me they just banned me, when I asked what is the reason of the ban, I finally got a response saying we don’t have any information for you, your just banned. I canceled the payment with my credit card so I’m not out of the money. It’s just a shady app that is just out to get your money. Plus most girls on there are just trying to get you to their Onlyfans or trying to sell their nude photos and underwear, I would say about 30% were regular girls looking to meet someone. If you still plan to use this app, I recommend not paying for any upgraded memberships.",Ricky_Nicky
Tinder,2022-04-13 14:38:25,Don't trust the 5-star rating,1,"This app has been 2 stars and below since they went for the pay to play method. They just delete all of their bad reviews and have their PR make multiple accounts for good reviews. Also, this app spams you with more and more useless notifications in a sad attempt to get you to use it. There is nothing more annoying than being woken up in the middle of the night just to see ""you have more swipes come use our subpar app."" Stop being money hungry and give an option to turn off your terrible notifications trying to get me to use your app. If it's not a pretty girl talking to me, then I don't want tinder notifying me.

Edit: this has literally became one of the buggiest, worst apps I have ever seen. Continuously adding useless content, constantly logs you out and ask you to reconnect with Facebook then just says ""account already given permission"" doesn't load things, filled with insane amounts of spam accounts, and ask you leave a review literally every time you use it even if you already have. Don't download this, and definitely do not support the developers.

Edit 2: got banned for telling a girl ""you are not in my dating bracket."" I've had this for 5 years.

Edit 3: the number of swipes have been reduced dramatically. You only get about 10-15 right swipes now. Still a terrible app.",Evilknights

I’ve always been respectful and even when guys have called me an ugly wh*re for not agreeing to sleeping with them tinder didn’t seem to have a problem with any of them. It’s genuinely weird to me that they will ban you at random with no explanation and refuse to open an actual appeals center to fix people who’ve been banned without reasoning. My account didn’t even go under review just woke up after not using it for a couple days and it informed me I’d been banned. The fact that so many people seemingly have this issue with no explanation from the company is awful and really discouraging.",Krackenkaren68)8272937392
Tinder,2021-11-30 08:34:06,Where the worlds most desperate come to beg for sex,1,"As a highly attractive successful woman, this app actually gives me nightmares. I can’t remember the last time I met a worthy prospect on here, it’s just full of creeps, stalkers, people desperate for sexual contact and weirdos. I would equate using this app to sifting through a garbage landfill looking for a 10 carat diamond. It’s extremely extremely rare to meet anyone of quality on this app. I have more luck finding guys who are (at the very LEAST) physically my type at the grocery store, hence the end of my time with this app. Goodbye tinder, thanks for the mental scarring and trauma. Oh and the fact that you allow men to be blatantly disgusting and overtly sexual to women with no repercussions. It’s called sexual harassment for a reason. Just because it’s online doesn't make it any less of a violation. Heaven forbid a woman say anything back though, she is promptly removed and blacklisted. This app is “for TRASH, and created by TRASH.”",Gatorgirl335
Tinder,2021-01-03 04:45:07,Good until it wasn’t,3,"I used tinder for a number of years. I visited my sister last summer, and she made a joke about me adding my payment info to my bio, saying I could get money from guys. I laughed it off, and the next morning I woke up and my account had been banned. I told my sister and she informed me that she had got into my phone and put my Venmo in my bio “as a joke” and didn’t know it was against the rules 
So I got banned for something I didn’t do, and my sister messaged their support team and they never answered. I had never had any warnings or problems on tinder so I definitely think it’s strange they would ban me immediately without warning and I’m really sad they never responded to my sister so I could potentially get my account back or have the chance to make a new one 
It’s still a good app tho, much better than other dating apps I’ve used",Autumn7499
Tinder,2021-11-14 21:47:57,Review:,5,"Tinder is a good app for people seeking conventional or unconventional relationships . Like most dating apps, it has its share of people who are trying to separate You from your wallet. It is YOUR responsibility to make sure that YOU  actually verify the identity of any person  you communicate with. A good tule of thumb: If a person cannot talk with you by telephone or video chat, chances are they are up to no good,

Never give anyone access to personal information or send ANYONE MONEY. Report those people asking for money or personal information  to the site immediately.

Give Tinder a chance; follow their rules, and my suggestions, and have fun. Who knows: HE or SHE might just be a right swipe away. Good Luck! He",Toddtheadd
Tinder,2021-08-19 15:03:02,Account banned in error,1,"I’ve successfully used and enjoyed tinder for the past three years and I have paid over $360 in subscription fees. Without any notice or review my account was banned in error. I have emailed 12 times and was replied back with with a copy and paste generic response each time Of their terms of use which I have read on the website several times already. At no point did I violate any such community guidelines. they refused to respond, there’s no help number or real person, there’s no way to get a refund or money back and more importantly there’s no proof violations which I’ve demanded a dozen times. My account was not hacked either. It seems like it could easily be a class action lawsuit for discrimination. 

My only other complaint about the app itself is about 15% of the time they would have male profiles on the female dating site in error In which I reported so they could fix the algorithm.",ale hair ninja
Tinder,2020-12-03 09:04:05,Terrible terrible terrible,1,"Tinder thought I wasn’t a real human.. after they confirmed that I’m real, I got back into my account to find everything a mess! Messages deleted, matches disappeared. I had matches messaging me on Instagram confused as to why I unmatch them! And then to add insult to injury I went from really popular to algorithms pretty much resetting on me.. now I have to start all over again.. terrible app & software. I’ve learned my way around the fake profiles and how to become popular, I can just imagine so many people using this getting depressed thinking they are not good enough. I think tinder should take some action and allow 1 profile per social security number or something that would make the app legit! For now it’s a safe haven for fake profiles & con artist doing con jobs! Tinder doesn’t care because they make money, even from the fake accounts! Shame on you tinder!

Tinder,2023-02-09 18:43:12,Horrible customer support,1,"So I’ve been a tinder user for a couple years on and off and I’ve met some great people and even friends. I consider myself a person with integrity and very respectful. One night I was on tinder, and the next morning I was banned. Now I didn’t have many matches, and barely engaged in convos and the last thing I remembered is that I matched with someone I’ve matched a couple of times before and sent them “how many times have we matched already”. Now idk if that’s the reason or why 
but I was banned the next day. I sent an email and provided all the information but basically all I got was, too bad you are permanently banned. And since tinder and hinge are the same company they banned my account on Hinge. What’s more frustrating is not knowing the reason. Idk if I was hacked or maybe someone I dated saw my profile and just wanted to report my account. It’s sad bc I’ve met some amazing ppl there.",123zeus777
Tinder,2023-01-13 06:27:58,Forced verification,1,"I never cared about additional matches due to a verified profile. I’m the person in my pictures, and didn’t feel like jumping through additional hoops. Although Tinder didn’t question my identity when they took my money for an upgraded version, they locked me out of my account after less than a week and demanded verification. When I attempted to use the tool, it wouldn’t load. I received messages from a couple of matches asking what happened to my account, only to learn it showed as deleted on their end. I finally got the verification tool to work and got my profile verified. Matches are showing on my end, but I’m not showing on theirs. I can match with new people, but can no longer reach the people I was corresponding with. There were a few people I was excited about getting to know.

Tinder,2022-02-14 23:04:23,Randomly Deletes Matches?,1,"Your app has gotten worse and worse at this and I now have proof that it happened. I was NOT unmatched, we both connected on a different platform and discovered that neither of us had unmatched the other. Updated my phone to the most recent version of iOS 15.3.1 today and miraculously the chat conversation is back and I got a notification like this was a new match. The chat is completely blank except for the first message they sent me a week and a half ago despite the conversation we had.

Tinder needs an “Unmatched” section where you can see those who have unmatched you and the conversation. Let them put in a reason for unmatching you or allow them to select “No I don’t want this person to see why I unmatched” or whatever. Remove the pictures and profile if you want to, but it’s simply maddening not knowing if you’ve been unmatched or in this case ghosted by Tinder.",RZAlexander
Tinder,2022-01-24 19:56:22,Multiple bugs,2,So I’m writing this review in early 2022 and there are so many bugs. The first is with videos. They are low quality when they appear on your profile and they keep disappearing and then I re-add them and then I’ll have 12 things on my profile when I preview (there’s only supposed to be 9) and I can’t remove the extra ones. The second is with the people they show you. There seems to be no algorithm whatsoever to show you people you will actually like based on who you’ve matched with before which isn’t really a bug but something they should think about. The bug is when I have it set to everyone it hides all the girls!!! There are only straight cis men holding fish like what in the world. Please fix these bugs and do better tinder. If not I’m going to find a different app to meet people and I bet others will too.,Primrose000
Tinder,2021-09-27 20:09:27,Used to be better,1,"This app used to be pretty good but it ignores age and range settings and just generally has a messed up algorithm. It’s obvious they have been pushing slowly over time to make people pay for it... It says I have a bunch of people who have liked my profile yet I won’t match with anyone or I’ll go to a city and then have people from that city show up on for weeks afterwards or match with some from that city literally weeks if not even months after (despite range settings and not useful when I’m there for a weekend, these people are like 200 miles away). I used to go on dates all the time off this app but more often than not I’ve found people just don’t respond or I won’t match w anyone despite the app telling me I have 99+ people who’ve liked my profile...

Tinder,2021-07-01 04:21:55,Banned for no reason,1,"I’ve had my tinder account for 5+ years now and have always used it the same. Swipe left/right and message people. Easy enough. Well I just updated and then went about it the same way I always have swipe right/left and messaged some people. I went back in and had no messages so I thought something was wrong with my internet went to bed and thought nothing of it. Came back in the next day to find my account had been banned - I read every single community guideline and the entire terms of use document and from what is written in there I did not violate a single one. But here I am banned and they aren’t doing the appeal process right now. So if you get this app don’t get too attached they will ban you for no reason 🤨. I reached out and asked them to explain why I got banned and they wouldn’t even do that, they probably don’t even know because I didn’t do anything wrong.",Bbbbrittttttt:)
Tinder,2021-07-05 14:10:38,"Fine, but no one’s there.",3,"I enjoyed using tinder. It’s very simple to use and better than some of the fake knockoffs that are going around. However, in the 1 1/2 - 2 weeks I was on it, I got maybe 6 messages in total. So either I’m right about myself that no one will actually like me and I’ll die alone, or some of the profiles are bots meant to make you think there are people when no one’s there. Also, I think the distance filter is glitchy, because even when it says there are no more within my set radius and it’s expanding my search criteria, there are still girls showing up as within my search radius. Also, there is no way there are that many people within a certain area on a dating app. I probably swiped a few hundred times finding girls within 30 miles of me.",legendahunter079
Tinder,2022-11-27 13:54:07,So much potential behind left to waste,1,"This app which should be the leader in dating apps has gotten very crest fallen and it’s disappointing. With so much potential to be greater than before when it was all everyone spoke of, it’s now loaded with tons of fake catfish profiles (foreigners spoofing their locations to seem local and foreigners you don’t want to see while not using their travel mode feature & asking to only be shown potential local matches). Then there’s the profiles pretending to be real only to promote their instagram and Snapchat in their bio. It’s really sad, tinder needs to do more for verification. People will trust it more if it proves trustworthy, and it’ll be a touch above the rest of apps out there because the name already lingers. But it needs people who care about it and it’s growth to run it, else it’ll die. Enough of the fakes, foreigners and other app promoting catfish profiles.

Removed Features from free users : I remember as a free user u get the ability of Super Likes now that’s completely gone behind a pay wall plus everything in this app is in a pay wall and soaking of the subject.

Payments on this app to expensive not worth it I rather get me a $30 video game than to pay $30 a month for Tinder Gold to expensive. Other companies go by $10 a month or $15 to $17 but $30? No that’s asking to much even if u did get $30 the women that swipe right on u may be a bot or to good to be true. I’m not gonna give up on the app I have some hope still gonna use it but seeing these successful beautiful women on here is to good to be true honestly.",ALonerGuy995
Tinder,2022-03-11 05:28:46,Deleted without cause,1,"I had an account for 5 years plus. I never violated any rules. I didn’t harass anyone online. Never promoted a product via messages. I certainly didn’t spam anyone. But I was suspended and given no recourse. No process where I could get a reason why I was suspended. No method to appeal and retrieve my account. 

The only reason I can think of is a woman who I had a date with (she wanted to hookup but changed her mind) reported me and made up some story simply because she didn’t like my political views and claimed I “mansplained” to her. I politely disagreed and left her home. A day or two later, my account was banned. Tinder was wrong. I was not just some account that had been made a week prior. I had been on and off for over 5 years and never had issues before that. I deserved a benefit of the doubt or at least some explanation as to why I was suspended.

Tinder,2021-11-14 18:45:34,So many bugs!,1,"I’ve never had so many matches from thousands of miles away!!! What’s the point of setting my distances so I can meet at ppl in my area just for thousands of guys from all over the planet to keep liking my profile. One guy was from NC & he matched me. But his distance was set to meet ppl in his area just like me so how did we match? I didn’t mind ppl from all over being able to match me but now it’s like it’s everyone & they don’t even message most of the time. Paying for likes was pointless I might just delete my profile or take a break from tinder. I’m not interested in conversing with anyone from a million miles away. Besides, I think they’re all bots there’s too many and sometimes they don’t reply. 🤷🏾‍♀️ Also they need an unread messages tab. Being popular on here is a curse because messages get lost in the shuffle. I will put this in every review until they do it. It’s necessary",Blackbabesupremacy
Tinder,2021-11-11 16:26:15,Junk,1,"The developers will tell you there are parameters and give you all sorts of explanations on why you aren’t getting matches, but after having a big group download the app, some of them paid and some didn’t. The ones that didn’t, didn’t see a quarter of the matches that the ones that paid did. They don’t show you everyone in the parameters that you set. How do I know? I was sitting right next to someone that could see many more. Even with the unpaid, the selections were not the same. I would be out of potential matches, change the age parameter and suddenly a bunch of matches (age range in the original parameters) came up. Like all other apps, this one is only concerned with making money. They don’t have your best interests in mind. I wouldn’t recommend this app to my worst enemy.

That being said, the filters which used to work (I think?) no longer do. I have minimum age set to 21, I’m in my mid 20’s I’m not trying to talk to a college freshman, yet I see more 18 and 19 year olds than anything. I’m also not interested in talking to someone who’s over an hour away. I wish it would allow you to set these filters as “dealbreakers” like some other apps do, as I’m having to pay attention to the age and distance on the profiles when it should filter them for me and save me the trouble. It also seems that using the app causes my phone to get slow and eventually freeze after a while. I enjoy swiping but I’d enjoy it a lot more if the filters did what they’re supposed to",jas1348
Tinder,2023-02-23 07:30:36,Fix Premium,2,"The app is fine, but I wouldn’t recommend buying premium in its current state. I get way fewer likes when I have premium, and your likes are certainly not a “priority” as is claimed. The only reasonable explanation for this would be that the person on the other end is intimidated by or draws negative opinions by seeing a premium user. If this is illogical to you (reader) then it’s very clear that the algorithm changes whether you have premium or not. You have to buy boosts to get any likes at all as a premium member. Seems counterintuitive and disincentivizes anyone from buying Tinder Premium. The day my premium membership ended, I got 50+ likes (in one day), when I was getting at most 2-3 likes a day with Premium. First, make it so your Premium membership can be hidden from other users. Second, fix the algorithm when a user has premium.",Cbach777

All was well until I get notifications saying the matches sent messages but when I check the message, there’s nothing there! So the conversations didn’t end this time because It went dry or because my joke didn’t land. No, this time it ended literally because I didn’t get the message! I had seemingly great chemistry with one of those matches too :/ 

It has me realizing I have never experienced a stable version of this app. As a developer myself, I get having a few bugs here and there but having used this app for years and experiencing glitch after glitch I can’t help but wonder if tinder truly cares about the user experience.

This decision is final, and so we may not respond to additional requests about this case. Regards, Elly” I didn’t violate any terms or community guidelines and it seems like a lot of people are having the same issue where they get banned with no explanation.

So I have 6 matches, then if you go into messages it will show the name of one, which was Angela. I get the feeling something fishy is going on. I sat and just continuously swiped left. It has been close to, I’ll say 750 profiles I’ve swiped through. I have liked 5 Angela’s not a single match and none of the others say you missed your match. How do I match with people that aren’t there. It’s pretty obvious they put up fake likes almost as soon as you register, so you pay to see who they are. In my opinion you’re never going to match with them because it doesn’t seem like they’re real. I’d also like to state I live in a rural area, I expanded my search radius to 70 miles and set the age 18-50. I also ran out of matches 7 to 8 times continuously expanding the search radius, still found none of the women who liked my profile.",Apple is garbage as well
Tinder,2022-09-01 22:45:07,Don’t Sign Up for this app if you’re straight,1,"So basically, I’ve been on this app for 4 years. At first it actually worked, I was meeting new women within my dating pool, in February of 2021, they changed their terms and services. By signing up you give them too much information, they must have a keyword system along the line of recommending everything you aren’t looking for (and you pay for it). You can waste as much money as you want on this app. It’s turned into another form of gambling for me  with the boost system and I would not recommend it. Also, might I mention they recommend you outside of what you select in the options for preferences. (You can’t change it) the likes you receive are pre determined and when you don’t like them back, they recommend you to bots and people of the opposite gender. They have an agenda that’s too progressive for my taste, and I’m sure many others.",Nick_Name 32
Tinder,2022-03-06 21:22:26,Pay Platinum but the bug filled app doesn’t deliver promised features,1,"Took us platinum couple of times but the app has too many bugs. Often see people liking me in notifications and can see the name but when you switch to seeing likes and trying to match the person will not be found. It’s annoying to pay that never works and then often the matches will vanish and reappear. Sometimes their messages will disappear and reappear. Often the person will send a message and it will show in message section that you received message and the preview of text, but when you open the chat interface, the message will not exist. Signing up for premium feature is like signing up for a maze where everything is random and feels sometimes that maybe other matches are bots created by the app itself or impactful high priority bugs that the engineering team is not fixing.",newuserb5

I’ve hooked up with people who were interested in my appearance and not who I actually was. This app is designed for gratification or base impulses, and it does a really poor job at helping you satisfy your desires if you’re a real, genuine human who is above social influences. Matches I’ve made are generally short lived, without conversation or engagement with any women I’ve matched with. To me, that reflects the shallow purpose of this app: “getting laid”. If you’re intellectual, struggle with emotions, or want something meaningful, avoid Tinder because it’s not meant for you. Most profiles are fake. I’d personally destroy this application if I could because I’ve been chronically rejected by almost every match I’ve made and it’s not my fault. I’ve paid for a Gold subscription and I want my money back.

Tinder,2021-12-07 03:57:07,Banned for nothing? Biased app,1,"People who are saying that they are getting banned for no reason on this reviews are absolutely right. I’ve enjoyed this app so much and met some interesting people atleast. I have not violated any terms, kept my photos decent, not harassed anyone as far as I know in person or in chat. But I admit that I have rejected many disrespectful men on this app and I’m thinking that is one of the reason why I got banned, which is pretty absurd. Come to think of it, this app doesn’t really care about its users and will just ban anyone in a blink of an eye without even letting them know why or giving them atleast a warning. They don’t even give a sht about appeals and doesn’t even care to investigate the issue. This app is also biased, racist, misogynistic and everything you can throw at it. Lazy and money greed developers and founder. Oh don’t forgot this sht is buggy asl too. I am hoping for this app’s downfall passionately.",hshijwj

The odds were .001% that I’d meet a girl that fits me so well on an app like tinder. Overall, I hated tinder. It was a waste of time. But I can’t crap on it when I’ve met my perfect girl. So I have to give it 5 stars, because we would have never met without this app. Don’t put all your bets on tinder working out, but it’s worth a try.

Easy to use and very nice overall. Hard to find good dating apps and this is definitely like the best one I’ve ever used. That being said- I hate that there isn’t an option to appeal. I have been using tinder for a while. As far as I knew, I hadn’t done anything to get myself banned. So I emailed customer support asking why I was banned, if it was a mistake, and if they were able to fix it. The response I got was “if you’re seeing an error message, it means your account has been banned.. we take violations of our policies seriously... we do not offer appeals at this time therefore your account will remain banned”

Prior to this hopefully bug, if you reached the end of your “stack” there were no more individuals to present you. 

The entire business is designed to induce choice paralysis and a false sense of endless potential with some nebulous perfect partner that no one meets. Why not take a second look at someone you didn’t really consider last time? Why not prioritize locals over travelers and those across the country? Why not increase the visibility of men and women alike who put more than 5 characters in their biography? Why not allow an option to only view verified accounts?",Did land jd

The tab that shows the messages between you and your matches and the tab that shows you status updates and photos, music etc. Well my account keeps losing the tab that has the matches updates, photos, music, etc. it’s frustrating and it makes me not want to use the app anymore. Plus I haven’t had any real success with it because the algorithm is weird as well. I’m a lesbian, and men still show up on my feed even when I don’t want to even see men’s faces on tinder. There’s a lot of improvements that need to be made. This one in particular with the match tab is the main thing.

I literally was banned completely out of the blue while having great conversations with people. There is no repeal process in place and I read all the terms and agreements and have never once broken any rules! This is an issue as I look into it, tons of other people have been banned for literally no reason.

I’ve seen other accounts that are fake and inappropriate but nothing was done about them but my account was banned for no reason. I only had the account for 4 days or so and paid tinder gold for it. I made some connections with people already and didn’t get their info on other social media and now I lost my connection to them because of the ban. I’m not even allowed to make future accounts.

No matches no messages, it’s just silence.  I change up my photos, I update my profile, If it were just me it would’ve always been slow. But this is a recent development. I think Tinder just changed it algorithm to keep people who aren’t paying exorbitant sums of money from getting any engagement at all. It makes this app a complete waste of time honestly. You would think I would at least get some action from some bots, but day after day swipe after swipe after swipe zero responses, and yes, all my parameters are set correctly. I just think Tinder has made it so if you don’t pay money you get nothing. That’s stupid, I’m ready to erase this app and find something different that will at least pretend like I’m getting some engagement. Screw you Tinder.",Dj_Sulli

To even be seen by other people (about half of whom are spam profiles anyway), you have to pay for a “boost”. Otherwise no one will even see your profile to swipe on you. This is true even if you pay $30/month for tinder “gold”. I found that after purchasing tinder gold and sending hundreds of right swipes over the course of many days, the result was 1-2 matches. When you stop swiping, the algorithm drops you to the absolute bottom of the stack and no one sees your profile. If I wasn’t actively spending time swiping every day, no one would swipe on my profile. 

Besides being dejecting to use, it’s a complete waste of time and money. Again, I have had no problem meeting people on other dating apps that are actually designed with the user in mind.",benSWEEET

Tinder will do everything and anything to try to get you to pay them money (say you have more likes than you do, create bot accounts to give you likes, etc.). Once you pay them, however, they stop putting up a front and let your account flop around in the seemingly endless sea of bots that is Tinder’s dating site.

Their only interest is money, and that’s very, very apparent now with the new “This profile is a popular profile” feature that asks you if you want to upgrade your like to a super like on someone, thus, buying the super like with real money.
The company does not, whatsoever, care for its users and push away probably a 3rd of their customer base due to this.",flipboardsown666
Tinder,2022-05-22 17:13:10,Their Profile Review is HORRENDOUS!!!,1,"I spent this money to super like women and get responses and then my account gets disabled to verify me as I’m actively talking to women and now I seem like a jerk and they may not talk to me anymore. This completely defeats the purpose! The process of verifying an account or person needs to be faster. The process should NOT take more than an hour at most! Also, some pics I have a beard and others I don’t so are they going to say that’s not me? Some my weight or face may be a little slimmer…? I’ve spent a lot of money on this account and now I can’t use it. I deserve a refund! This is horrible management! Also, if they delete my account or ban me I’m reporting this as fraud to my credit card company… they could have asked to link my account to my Facebook, I have an instagram as well that I could have linked if requested, so many faster ways to handle this. This is unacceptable!",Kimbo5355
Tinder,2022-03-04 04:59:14,My Honest review,1,"Okay so where do I begin as far as community goes it’s a decent app I’ve met some amazing people on the dating application all and all it’s not bad, maybe some one the women arnt my preference but their is someone for everyone 

My only complain is I’ve been banned for absolutely nothing, I hardly communicate with other profiles and when I do I’m always courteous and respectful because I’m not a creep mainly just a single dude looking for someone 

As far as the banning, I got it with no warning or even foreshadowing, I’ve tried communicating with their support channel but have never gotten anything back ever, if not for being banned for some random reason other then violations the community standards then I’d give this app atleast 3 star, it seems alittle over monetized and seems pretty predatory to me the way they market certain features and lock you out of other but oh well I’m banned anyways 💀",887CashNow
Tinder,2021-12-18 12:23:45,Banned for no reason,1,"Every time I tried to log back in my old account, it said my account doesn’t exist. So I sent them several emails and didn’t get any useful support. So I just opened a new account yesterday and everything was well until they asked for the photo verification. After the photo verification, it’s taking more than 10 hours under review. So I contacted them and they said they will check it out and let me know. This morning, I just found out that my account has been banned for violating terms of use or community guidelines. I used my real photo, email, phone number and Facebook account. I just chatted with a guy and didn’t say any spam or hateful words. I emailed them again to check it out since it could be a mistake. All I received is they do not offer the appeals process at this time. And I found many people like me here. Tinder is such a big disappointment.",Yu Nandar 1998
Tinder,2021-09-15 22:57:01,"Constantly removing features, too many scammers/bots/fakes",1,"Over the past few years this app has become increasingly more paywall restricted and removed features for free/paid users, while failing to do much of anything about bots and scammers. 

 They’ve added a daily like limit and removed daily super likes for free users, reduced super likes for the pay tiers from 5 per day to 5 per week, and made no significant upgrades to app functionality outside of a few trivial ones like “Vibes” and adding a messaging option to Super Likes for the highest pay tier, which is an absolutely absurd $40/mo. All the while bots, scammers and fake users are as prevalent as ever. 

 So what are they doing with all this money they’re making from these increasingly expensive pay tiers they’re adding? They’re certainly not reinvesting in meaningful upgrades for free or even paid users. Every year or so they’ll add some new “feature” that no one really asked for and then increase prices and/or lock another free feature behind paywalls shortly thereafter. It’s getting tiresome and apps like Bumble, Hinge and OkCupid are much more user friendly nowadays, without locking messaging for everyone but paid users and matches. 

 Don’t waste your time as the app only seems to be getting worse, try one of the aforementioned ones instead.",Shino-bird
Tinder,2021-08-03 05:23:35,Banned without reason,1,I have used this app for close to 3 and a half years meanwhile I change nothing and act no different in the entire time I’ve had the app but yet I log in one day to “your account has been banned” with no explanation or anything. There is no appeals process to know what was done wrong if anything or any way to right a wrongful ban. This is completely and utterly useless and not only this but a friend of mine went to log into their account on my phone since I couldn’t use mine anymore and it banned their account as well so this app either needs to create an appeals process or fix their app because I will recommend any and every person I meet against using this app so that their time isn’t wasted just to be banned for no reason and then lose the entire time they’ve spent on the app because the algorithm decided it didn’t like one thing on their profile,cwhosk
Tinder,2021-06-17 22:28:07,Banned/Shadow Banned,1,"I’ve made 3 accounts in the almost year I have had tinder. My first one I had for 7 months it got banned and no explanation why I didn’t use it a lot and I was on my laptop and phone using it all of a sudden it says banned. I got no where with customer service because you know mass majority of tinder is bots. Then I made another account and got shadow banned then I said screw it I’ll make one more account it got shadow banned I got customer service and they said nothing is wrong then all of a sudden I had alot of people liking and matching with me. Had that account for a month then I get banned and I have given up. You can get banned for cussing, multiple reports (so if people don’t like that you’re not messaging you fast enough you can get reported by them), or constant messages. I fully do not advice anyone to have tinder, bumble is better just pricer if you’re gonna pay.",AlexisAlaniz
Tinder,2021-03-25 05:37:42,Being hindered from getting matches,1,"The app itself is preventing me from even matching with people now. At first, I used to think that maybe my profiles were not that great as it used to be. I am typically on and off tinder every few months/years when I find a connection. the past couple of months however I have gotten little to no matches. At first i thought that maybe it was me. But when I compare myself to my friends, I realize that the problem is the app itself. Boosts and tinder gold does little to solve my problem. My photos are great quality but for some reason I’d be lucky to get 1 match. I’ve tried resetting my account but the same problem persists. Even my female colleagues that I send SUPER LIKES to don’t even get them. It’s safe to say that tinder’s algorithm may have most likely shadow banned my account. 

Tinder hasn’t responded to any of my emails so its safe to say this is true.",Chuzzarino
Tinder,2020-11-25 02:04:00,Honest review,5,"The amount of girl’s on my this app is astonishing. So the user base is there but the app has some serious functionality problems and other anomalies that if fixed, could take this app to next level. One issue is not getting messages or seeing matches. I always get notifications on my iPhone that I have a new tinder match or message. Yet when I go to the app, there is nothing there. After doing some research I found that you have to turn your phone off then back on to get your messages and matches some times. There are other issues, I just don’t have the time to write them right now. I will say, the app is good overall and I have acquired new relationships from it.",ACE-93
Tinder,2022-06-23 18:04:28,Getting useless on every “up?-date”,1,"This app was good enough to meet people but over the last years every update seem do downgrade the functionality. Now if full of bug, crashes, freezes and lately notifications are crazy. Keep showing 4 notifications in badges but there is no matches or messages (bug evidence)! Every time there are more features you have to pay for and less usefulness. No more blue stars, reduced likes per day, etc. The worst is the diatance feature because several matches appear to be a mile away but in the messages appear thousands of miles away! (evidence of useless). Money, then more money and finally more money until useless!!!.
ps: How come apple gives “editor’s choice award” to this cr-app! (how ever it is explaines by the the disappointing performance of apple devices in the last 4 years). Neither apple nor tinder are what they were used to be!",u77
Tinder,2022-03-02 05:30:51,Golden days of over,1,"Tinder used to be a decent way to meet people. Now it’s just a cash grab and ultimately a waste of time. The ad revenue isn’t enough for them and my friends that have been successful on the app after it became a cash grab paid for boosts (they lied about it ofc, but I caught them in their lie). I used to have pretty good luck on here back when Tinder was relatively new, but now it’s just a waste of time and after the first day of being a free member it’s clear no one sees my profile (I’ll rack up likes the first day, then suddenly nothing). It’s obvious why it works this way and resetting your account doesn’t cut it anymore. Tinder also has next to zero respect for GDPR and won’t disclose all of the information they keep on you (Google it). I wouldn’t be surprised if they are doing shady things with your information (which includes their method of sabotaging the effectiveness of a profile reset).",Dielan44 Studios
Tinder,2020-12-01 11:42:21,Banned and no helpful feedback,1,"I only had tinder for a few weeks and then was banned out of nowhere. I had a weird interaction with a user so I stopped replying that day then next thing I know I was banned when I opened the app after driving for a few hours. I emailed Tinder and they just said I violated the terms and conditions which I actually went through and read and I didn’t violate any of them. I did some research and it said if someone reports your account then they automatically ban you which I think is crazy because there was nothing wrong with my account nor my interactions on the app. Wish they were more transparent about why people are banned and an actual process for the situation. Also the app crashed a lot which was annoying.

replying here cause idk how to on the thread, but I am banned so the technical tips aren’t gonna help me lololol but then again it will i guess if y’all give me my account back",BBreezz
Tinder,2023-04-16 18:16:49,Banned for no reason??,1,"So, I was banned before I even got to make my account. I tried to sign up on my 18th birthday and it gave me the message, “We detected that you may not meet the minimum age requirement yet. We look forward to seeing you at 18. Until then? Enjoy your youth.” It gave me an option to correct this with an ID, but just turning 18, I do not have a valid ID of my own just yet, (I am in the process of getting one, though). To see if I could use something else, like my birth certificate or SSN, I contacted them to attempt to correct this wrong; instead, I got an email stating that I was banned for violating the terms of service. How can I be banned without even having accessed the app? I haven’t even gotten through the entire sign-up process and apparently, I am banned. Congratulations, Tinder, on making a great impression. I am more than happy to follow up with a well deserved 1-Star rating.",WeatherCtrl
Tinder,2023-04-04 22:51:15,They ban you for no reason & so many bugs,1,"I’ve used this app many many times. Consistently almost. I even had the Tinder Gold subscription. There are soooo many issues. 1) they have a million bug issues. I would get a notification of a message, open the app to see it, and nothing. I would have to log out and back in almost every time I wanted to check messages. 2) I recently got banned for no reason. I’m a conservative dresser, so no provocative pictures, no foul language, etc. So for me to be banned makes no sense. I was just having normal conversations, even was planning a date later that night, when I went to open the app to message them and to my surprise I was banned. I’m not the first girl this has happened to either. At this rate with how many people have gotten banned for practically no reason there aren’t going to be many people left on the app.",AnnaK817

If you really want more people on your app it’s best to change some policies. You held my money from me because I changed my phone number. If you held it for me to do some security verification and release it in few hours it would have been nice. But you hold bitcoin up for 2 days. That’s wickedness. Knowing fully well that anything can happen. It could increase or decrease. And it’s been decreasing since I last checked. I need my money back before the end of today. I should have checked your reviews before I signed up for this app. More bad comments about the app than the good. If there any human beings reading this please I need my money ASAP. Can’t wait for 48 hours. Not even 24 hours 48 hours. If you were in my position will you wait talking to the man who made this policy. Funny how it’s only applied to only the users in Nigeria.

Binance,2021-04-11 18:25:51,Don’t waste your time.,2,"The only thing good about the app is it’s interface. If I didn’t have this one problem I would be obsessed with the app. The customer support is basically non existent. You have to submit a ticket if you have an issue, but don’t express a response. I’ve attempted over 300 times to purchase crypto directly and deposit money to my account, and only TWO times did I find success. I was allowed two times to purchase crypto directly from my linked bank account. I’ve deleted and add my bank 100 times, that doesn’t work. I’ve submitted multiple tickets. No response. I’m transferring the very little crypto I was allowed to purchase to a wallet and I’m switching over to another app.

It’s very upsetting because the app offers a variety of crypto and low fees. The only thing I can’t do is purchase the crypto. It seems like a lot of people have this problem so I wonder how they even make money.

I had a few crypto stocks I wanted to add huge investments to but could not even buy them due to my account not being verified, I tried to contact customer support and they have an automatic set up you can’t contact them through email, and filing a ticket doesn’t even matter because they won’t get back to you. To top it off they do not have a phone number to talk to an actually person, if you use the app and have this same issue, I’d advise not to call any of the number google or the random websites say is Binance’s phone number they’re obvious scams. I deactivated my account and deleted the app and told my friends about my experience if I get a response back describing my situation to help me understand what happen along with a phone number or actually non-automatic email I’ll change the review.",King Banks M
Binance,2021-06-17 03:22:32,"Be careful, you could loose your investment",1,"When markets move in a favorable direction many users reported their accounts locked.

My account was locked  from February through May 2021 on both Binance and Binance US. Magically, my accounts were unlocked after market took a steep dive. Binance, virtually offers no customer support, no phone to call, no follow up email. You will only get an acknowledgment email to confirm that customer support received your complaints.  I tried hundreds of times without a response. I moved to my accounts their main competitor. FTC needs to jump in and regulate.

Binance,2020-06-07 21:21:03,Cluttered GUI,4,"The exchanges GUI is cluttered. I end up touching something I didn’t mean to touch because all the buttons are close to each other. I understand they want this to be user friendly by placing everything in the open so nothing is hidden but it just makes everything messy. Add menus and you can free up space on the GUI. It’s hard increasing and decreasing price of coins we are selling in the exchange without hitting something else and causing the screen to swipe. Same goes for the amount buttons to increase and decrease the amount of coins we are selling and buying in the exchange screen. 

Also id like to be able to see market/price history on the buy/sell screen so I can see how much a coin was being sold for last month as I’m pricing it for selling without having to change screens and go to the other market tab to engage prices. 

Oh and most importantly there should be a note when selling coins that there’s a bare minimum of .1 before we go to sell our coins. I wasted time setting up a coin to sell just to find out afterwards I didn’t have enough coins to sell which wasted minutes of my time. So minimums and other rules should be made visible at all times. 

Other than that it’s a good app. 4 stars.",cmj141
Binance,2021-11-16 14:47:55,Mobile application trend lines changes,3,"Unfortunately the mobile app has recently changed regarding the drawing of trend lines. This app was absolutely fantastic to draw trends, change past drawn lines and being able to see approximately the date of intersecting trends. There was no announcement of the update/changes and I want Binance to read this feedback so as to change things back to what they were. The app was a well deserved 5 star rating but now it is not as helpful as it was. 
Even on stochastic indicators, trend lines and cursor could be dragged over to see values of RSI, KDJ and so on easily, user-friendly like no other app.

Now we are to the point they are asking me for multiple IDs, and recording a VIDEO of myself showing the date and IDs and myself logged into the page and they STILL are responding back saying things like “oh you didn’t say this right” and “you need to also video your withdrawal history” (which doesn’t exist because they won’t let me withdraw”.

However, a couple updates back i noticed a sudden change in performance when you enter trade charts, open the buy/sell menu, and leave trading charts in particular where the app consistently stalls for a one or two second period before the action is carried out. This used to not happen and makes it difficult to quickly switch between trades and buy or sell on mobile. These used to happen almost instantly.

But the entire registration and verification process is broken as F___! And from the family and friends that told me their personal experiences about Binance, I can keep trying (to infinity) or give up.  Binance is that bad, at least with ID verification and proof of address, etc.  the advice is to keep trying, uploading the same PDF document and with any luck, 6 months later, it will magically get approved.

I supposed it could be a Robinhood app, and Binance will disrupt trading, force liquidate positions, just because they are undercapitalized and think they can do it without legal and civil ramifications. 

Oh, the Binance mobile app and their website can’t agree on my login credentials either. At first I thought I downloaded the wrong app and my login is actually being sent to the database of a phishing con artist.

Binance,2020-07-10 05:31:09,Fix freezing and glitches,3,"Before the last major update, the binance app never had a problem. The exchange window is extremely glitchy now, always freezes, will display BTC/USDT order book when I am trying to see another coin, will not refresh pages smoothly if it even refreshes at all, crashes often... it just isn’t as reliable anymore. The isolated margin actions such as borrow, repay, and transfer are glitchy as well. Non-executed orders don’t show up like they used to now, requires ~5 refresh attempts now. I used to rely on the app when the website slowed down, but now I can’t trust it. Please fix back to the way it was.",WilsonG777
Binance,2021-09-30 08:31:38,Criminals,1,"I was one of Binance’s first customers in 2017

I’ve held BNB since it was less than $1 and still hold it. 

Well now that CZ is kicking us off after giving in to supporting all that goes against crypto, I no longer can use it even with a VPN. 

So I temporarily went over to Binance U.S. but they stole $50,000 from me the first month I was there a year ago and never gave it back because they messed up my KYC. 

They stole $96,000 from another friend that nearly bankrupt him right when he had his first child.

They stole around $20k from another friend who attempted to self harm himself when he couldn’t get help to get his life savings back. 

It’s wrong. 

Then CZ allows Brian Brooks, a criminal, to run Binance U.S. like this with no customer service or care for people’s lives.

The person on Twitter said they were fixing it this time and making special effort to get it right 47 times! And they never remembered me after each time. 

I never got my money back, but bad things are coming for the entire Binance name, so stay far away or you’ll likely end up like me and my friends.",TheLukeShort

The worst part about all this is that they claim the right to retain all of your private information for 6 years after deactivation.

I tried to complete my registration to Binance site but at the end I found that My country (Iraq) is not listed and some kind of ban for Iraq and some countries,, 
With respect to your regulation but seems no sense to put few countries in like this list , because if there is a law or regulations or ban should applicate for any kind of illegal financial transection or political issues should be done for many and many other countries accepted already for registration in your site,  that we know they are the way for illegal world money transfer and money laundry.
 plus all operations normally under control by you and the international government (if I understood your site policy well).
So please review this point very well and under the rights of using internet and its applications I would like to ask you kindly to explain your reasons to put a ban on my country and other five or six countries.

Just as others have written about, I have experienced the same roadblocks. Can’t satisfy their requirements for verifying my identity, uploading photos and videos only to be told they need some other ridiculous information. I am now convinced this is simply a tactic to steal money from U.S. investors.  Given that this is a Chinese platform, there is nothing that can legally be done.  Buyer beware!!",victim of a Binance Scam

As you see a stock rising, you try to trade for it but you can’t because in those few seconds you set up the trade the stock rises and you have to wait for the price to come back down in the order. What’s the point of that??? By that point I already don’t want the stock and I’m likely to lose money. 

Hey binance. How about you give us the price of the stock we had at the time of purchase numbnuts. Frustrating. I hate this app.",Ratious Majatious
Binance,2022-06-09 15:57:32,Blocked my access and kept my data,1,"Binance is marketed as a platform for multiple countries, but doesn’t work as advertised. I could not access my home Binance account (Brazil) from the US. Don’t open an account thinking you will be able to access it worldwide because you won’t. 

Since I cannot access the account, I can also not:
- turn off email marketing
- change account settings or remove linked financial information
- close the account

Customer Service was able to “disable” my account for me, but without deleting my data.   They kept my data. 

As a result, Binance now has all of my personal information and I have no access or control over any of it. And they are still sending me marketing emails which I cannot unsubscribe from.",goyert

Binance,2022-05-03 09:09:14,You can do better,4,I think Binance should consider a redesign of the app. It’s so difficult to know how ones P/L vs the investment changes.

Spotify,2022-08-06 20:05:26,Best App,5,"This app is by far the best music service I’ve ever used. (Music platforms I’ve used premium for: SoundCloud, Apple Music) Out of all of the platforms I’ve used, this one trumps all of them by having the greatest variety of songs. Literally all of my music is on here, including covers, nightcore, pop, rock, indie, alternative, rap, and foreign genres like kpop and jpop. It also has the lyrics automatically displayed and as someone who likes to sing and sometimes read for better lyrics comprehension, this is a great feature to have! Of course I have premium but I’ve used the free version for a considerable amount of time, and I can say that it’s definitely worth it to get premium for no ads, unlimited skips, and infinite playlist customization. I love listening to playlists I’ve created on this app! I have over 20 of them so far. This feature is awesome; you can share playlists with friends (and even collaborate with them on playlists too!), put a custom cover image, add a description, and add whatever songs you want. I like this feature because then I don’t have to manually change songs every time one ends. The fact that you can download songs is great too, and this app works on very low bandwidth so if you’re on a plane that offers wifi you can listen without having to worry. Overall I’d say if you’re considering going premium, this app is a must have! But if you want the free version, just know you’ll have limited control over what you play and when you play it.",V.143

Spotify,2021-09-29 05:02:23,"bluetooth/wired connection to car, library format",4,"I always connect to my scion ia via bluetooth, sometimes I plug the wire in so that it can charge while I drive, and for some reason, like half the time, buttons like ""like"" or ""add to playlist"" or ""make playlist private"" or ""delete playlist"" etc just do NOT work at all. I click and theres no visual feedback. I check and the song was not liked and the plaulist was not deleted. Sometimes it marks songs as ""liked"" and I never liked it before. This is stupid. Sometimes I just want to park and listen to music and want to use those features at the same time and I can't for no apparent reason. Please fix it. It's frustrating and also makes me feel crazy bc I thought I liked a song or added to a playlist and turns out it just never went through. Or I hit add to playlist and it actually does do it, BUT gives me no visual feedback or confirmation, doesn't ask me ""this song is already in the playlist"", nothing.  So yeah, great app but some features don't work in my car.

Also I HATE that you made the Library tab include everything and I have to hit ""Playlist"" to filter my library to just playlists. Why are you putting in an extra step for no reason. It doesn't make any sense to clog the list up with artists I liked. You can like like hundreds of artists and I simply do not have that many playlists.

Spotify,2021-03-31 02:03:47,It keeps stopping,3,"A problem I frequently have is that when listening to my music, the songs will randomly stop playing and when I go to hit play again, the app restarts. Sometimes admittedly, it’s just because my app needs updated, but it will also do that completely randomly at times. What is with that? I’ll continue playing my music again, and not only will the song restart, but it also cuts off again but even earlier than it did before. It’s honestly extremely annoying and very difficult to deal with when I’m working either at home or at my job. Nine times out of ten, I’d have to close the app completely, and wait thirty to ninety minutes before my music will play uninterrupted again. It’s incredibly frustrating, especially since all I want is to play some music. 

Another thing is six skips per hour? Really? That’s so incredibly annoying, and it makes it worse when I’m wasting all my skips on the stupid suggested tracks you give me. I don’t want to listen to that!? If you absolutely HAVE to put something in, play more of the same artist at least. It’s so annoying to only have six skips and waste them all on music that I never wanted to hear in the first place. The worst part is, even if I go to a different playlist and come back, it continues playing the suggested track. I don’t want it! On that note, I also don’t want the extra songs you put in my playlists. I take one track off, another gets added. If I wanted that song in my playlist, I’d put it there.",GoldenShadow127
Spotify,2021-06-06 17:25:40,Calm down with the long commercials.,4,"I could be wrong, but isn’t it better to hit people with quick, to the point, shots of why we should get the product? The 30 second commercials seem too long; forget about 2 min of hearing about each product. And do ya have to keep repeating the same thing 3 different ways? And that’s if there’s creativity involved; if not it’s just repeat the same words back to back to back to back. So you’re saying we haven’t got any smarter since Biblical times? Back then, making the point repetitively was the best way to get info to stick in our thick skulls. Here’s the truth -that you can only change by distracting me with annoyance at 90 seconds of redundant raving- I will “click here” if I’m truly interested! Which seems like what the goal should always be. Here’s 15 seconds of this great product, wanna know more? Click here to go to the site. And if now isn’t the right time, then “click over here ~tell me later; take me to the site in 20, 30, 50 min etc.” I realize that 25 years ago our entertainment came with over 20% commercial time. No choices, just the way it was   -sit there and wait. And it was too much advert info then. And now we get all this “free” info\entertainment on the interwebs. But it’s somehow even more advert info now! Deflating difference is; it’s now everywhere, all the time, nowhere to look if you don’t want pitch, pitch pitch.",TravelingCowboy74
Spotify,2022-01-05 03:54:08,Issues with playing music,3,"Before I start, I wanted to say that I would've rated this app a 4-Star but I just have some issues. First I wanted to state that I have a big issue with making playlists. I hate how I have to literally search up songs to add into my playlist, like why can't I just go into my ""Liked"" music and add any of those songs into playlists so that it makes my life easier? Because I can't do that, I literally just go onto my liked songs and listen through there but its annoying cause I listen to many genres and sometimes I just sit and skip through songs just to find the right one. It's annoying and I just wish you guys made it easier. 

I also wanted to bring up that recently, I literally can hardly play my music because it always just stops and cuts off. At first, I thought it was an issue with my car's bluetooth so I just connected my wire to play music through ApplePlay but that didn't stop the issue either. When I tried playing music with my earphones on, it kept doing the same thing. I would literally have to restart the entire app just for it to work but then it would just randomly cut off again. Because of this also, I only rate 3 stars. Please fix all of this, or I will be forced to just switch to Apple Music because I'm honestly just getting tired of all this nonsense. I had backed you guys up a lot and claimed you guys as the most efficient music app but now I'm having other thoughts.",DeezNutsForPresident
Spotify,2021-04-12 18:06:17,not bad music source but could be better,3,"Okay, i have been using this app for a while and have experienced lots of weird things. First i want to talk about the shuffle thing. you can shuffle songs so that it picks random songs in any playlist, but thats where my huge problem is. you cant pick specific songs you just have to listen to the playlist until it plays that song. and if you have shuffle mode on for a little bit then you cant turn it off.. so, shuffle mode has a lot of disadvantages.  I cant get rid of shuffle mode so I saw another glitch. Lets say that i decided to make my own playlist, I make it and other songs are added just because of shuffle mode, but you can add songs to get rid of them. Okay, then my playlist “ends” and then RANDOM songs play.. I have to play a different playlist now. and sometimes if i return to the one that i was playing the song is still there, and if i skip it more random songs will start playing, then i have to wait a whole HOUR to get more skips. I feel like non premium users should have more freedom of doing what they want. oh, and with shuffle mode on, you cant pick a song or make it into a loop. and like i said, after a little bit you cant turn shuffle mode off. So yeah, this app could definitely improve more things. Also, please don’t take what i'm saying the wrong way. Thank you for reading, and it would be a pleasure if one of these got fixed! Byee!!❤️",siAksv
Spotify,2021-11-18 20:04:53,My app is having issues,4,"I’ve used this app A LOT. I remember a feature about a year ago where it showed you the lyrics on all of the songs, but it caused my app to crash every time I played a song. It would play the song halfway through and then crash and I would go back into the app and it had restarted the song. It would do this in a cycle until I skipped the song because I couldn’t handle hearing the first half of the song on repeat anymore. Occasionally it would work for one or two songs but that only happened rarely. Basically I could only hear half songs because the app kept crashing, and then I would use up all six of my skips and have to turn off the app. And I was SO relieved when after multiple months of suffering through this. Music means more to me now than it has ever, and here’s why im writing this; because I woke up this morning and saw that the lyric feature was back. I was very excited because I was hoping they had brought it back because they fixed the bugs it caused. Sadly the first song I tried to play made the app crash. I want to make you aware that I have a recent iPhone model with plenty of space on it, so it is not my phone causing these issues. Please PLEASE fix this quickly. Music is my comfort and my joy, I don’t know what I’ll do without it working. Please PLEASE PLEASE I beg you to fix this as fast as possible.",PowerFlash27
Spotify,2020-02-07 02:25:00,Shuffle play only for people with the free plan... really?!?!!,5,"I really do like this app and it’s cool music but I have one problem with it. People that don’t have a premium membership (have a free plan) are only able to play songs by shuffle playing. You use to be able to choose whatever song you would want to listen to on your playlist and you could shuffle play too but now you are only able to shuffle play if you don’t have the premium membership, and also, when I tap on the list of all of my songs in my playlist and I find a song that I want to play, it only plays a preview of the song. I think the shuffle play is kinda dumb because whenever I shuffle play it and my last song on my playlist stops playing (because the song is over) it moves on to a new song that I haven’t added to my playlist and whenever I hit the button that says “Shuffle Play” it controls if the song is paused or playing. I tried exiting out and reopening the app but the song is still there and acts as if it’s in my playlist.
I would give this app 5 stars if it weren’t for the shuffle play only thing.
Please change it so that people that don’t have a premium membership can listen to whatever songs they’d like too. Thanks for listen and have a good day.",Zack_SillyBoi735
Spotify,2022-05-29 01:56:02,I loved it at first.. But I might switch back to SoundCloud,2,"I originally got on this app because my friends told me it was so much better. If you are on a computer or iPad, this app is absolutely amazing. The app recommends songs to you, makes custom playlists, and has an overall great experience. But if you are like me, who likes to listen to music anywhere on your phone, it’s absolutely unbearable to use it for free. After my free trial with premium, I tried starting my playlist while it was on shuffle. I got very confused on why I couldn’t play my songs in order, and then I realized it was because I didn’t have premium, I was very disappointed in this app. I was listening to one of my favorite songs and wanted to replay it, but I realized I wasn’t able to. I searched up the song to try and see if I could listen to it again, and instead it gave me a shuffle playlist with 20 other songs I would be forced to listen to. You also get limited skips a day, which I find completely unreasonable. This app has a few positive features, like how it recommends new sons based on your playlist, but what’s the point if you can barely even listen to it? In my opinion, on mobile, this app is completely “pay to win.” I don’t see any point in it being free if it’s awful on your phone, which I feel is much easier and convenient to listen on, and this app definitely took advantage of that. For mobile users like me, I don’t recommend this app.",EVERYTHNG IS TAKEN AAAAAA
Spotify,2023-04-06 22:52:26,Best music app by far but room for a couple of improvements,5,"I’ll start with some new(er) changes I enjoyed. I like how when i click on my profile in the top left the menu now provides a better looking UI, easier to get to my settings. Another newish thing I loved is when i add a new song to a playlist, it’s a check the playlists instead of only being able to add it to one playlist at a time, definitely a time saver. 
     Now for some new tweaks. 
I would like to see more customization with the quick swiping right or left on a song. There should be a setting to be able to change what a swipe left or a swipe right means instead of it always being queuing a song or liking it.
The other feature I would like added is to be able to change the order on how your playlists display on your public profile. Let’s be honest, there are definitely better playlists that are created than others. I feel like this could be done two different ways.

Spotify,2021-08-02 16:10:40,"Needs improvement, overall good",5,"Okay, so this is a great app if you’re a normal person that only has around fifteen or so playlists. But I’m not normal and i like to make loads if playlists and then i need to delete them. I think a really good feature you could add to this app is a delete button on the playlists tab. It would help with being able to select a mass number of playlists to easily delete. It would also be good to have a similar feature with adding songs. If there were a button that allowed you to add the same song to multiple playlists at once, instead of having to go through each playlist and add the song individually. Also, it would be good if in a playlist you could organize where each song goes like if you want to organize it alphabetically or something on mobile. Finally, it would be nice if you could add a way to view the amount of streams an album has, or make it easier to see. A group of people including me are trying to get an album to a certain number of streams, and I can’t view the number, although i think other people can, so if you could make the streams a bit easier to access that would be nice. Overall great app, needs improvements though ;)",cupcakego
Spotify,2021-01-17 02:21:55,"Lack of options, randomly censored songs",3,"This app is really annoying in the sense that I can’t organize my music the way I used to. The “Genre” option doesn’t even exist. If you want to organize by artist/album it has to download your artist/album’s songs. It’s just a bunch of ridiculous extra buttons that I shouldn’t ever need to deal with. 

My least favorite thing about this app is, songs will randomly become censored without warning. That means, I was in a huge Johnny Cash phase, and had listened to “A Boy Named Sue” like a hundred times, then one day, the line goes from “I’m the son of a ***** that named you Sue” to “I’m the [BLEEEEEEEEEEEEP] that named you Sue”. Like WHY. All of my songs are fine, but one day suddenly one will be censored after enjoying it for months. I’m paying for this service, and have no parental settings or anything turned on to make that happen on my end. This should not ever happen.

Besides that, it’s decent enough as a music app. Music comes out fine, making playlists is easy, they do have a wide selection of music, and even have personalized playlists that aren’t so bad a lot of the time. I can organize my songs in any order I want to. Sure, if I want songs organized by genre, I have to make an entire separate playlist or just listen to a pre-made playlist with songs that I don’t even care about that I have to constantly skip and skip and skip, but hey, at least it’s somewhat possible.",espeonics
Spotify,2021-07-29 18:22:29,"Free experience, I like it but…",3,"After using the app for a month I was impressed that I was able to pick the songs that I wanted to listen to as well as the albums and podcasts.

However, since I haven’t purchased anything to lose a majority of functions such as picking individual songs that I would love to start listening to instead being treated to something entirely different from the song I picked is frustrating, cause what is the point of liking songs if I am unable to listen to those songs, because I haven’t gotten premium. I don’t mind listen to ads if it gets me to the song I want to listen to or skip a song that I don’t want to listen to then slowly transitions into more songs. This makes the search function obsolete if I search for a song only to get something completely different from the song I wanted. Or look for an album that I want to listen to only to not listen to the whole album. Though picking specific podcast episodes seems to function the way the whole app should.

If you want this for free, there are a lot of issues that I found makes it hard to find what you want to listen to or pick out specific songs that you want making liked songs unimportant if you can’t listen to them at a later time. Which is a shame cause the first time I downloaded it, really showed how amazing it is.",Rojiace5
Spotify,2021-03-31 22:54:07,Glitch,5,"I like this app and I actually like that it suggests other songs to listen to because I like finding new music that fits into my category. I’m even okay with the only six skips an hour thing because I’m not picky and I have multiple playlists I can listen to. However, for some reason every time I’m listening to the music nowadays the app will randomly exit out and stop playing music. I have to physically get back into the app just to restart the song I’d been listening to, and it always starts back up at like 0:07, so I’ll listen to like 3/4 of the song AGAIN just for it to cut out and I have to restart the process over. Just now I listened to the same song seven times in a row without completion. This is a consistent problem that’s pushed me to write a review (which I don’t normally do). I’ve even gone online to see what I can do to fix it and tried all the suggestions (exiting out of all other apps, completely logging out of my account and logging back in, etc.) and it still does it. Like I said, I can make do with the small amount of skips per hour and even the suggestive songs to my playlists but this is getting ridiculous since I can’t even do what the app is made for. 👎",aspiringwritertobe
Spotify,2020-11-16 01:59:56,Love it but..,4,"This app is awesome! I love how you can listen to your own music, and share it. But I don’t like how it adds music to your playlist, and won’t let you remove it. I don’t get that I really hope you fix it soon. Also, when I only want to listen to my music it makes me listen to a suggested track that I can’t get out of. What is with that? And, there is too many ads. And only 6 skips per HOUR?! Why? And, when my playlist is making me listen to other songs, I have to go to a different playlist, listen to 1 song in it, come back to my playlist, and there it is. another song I don’t need. I am probably one of those users that will get ignored, but if you are looking at this, congratulations. You get a gold sticker. I wish that the users without premium could get AT LEAST 10 skips and hour. It’s not fair with only 6 per hour. I also want to add, that when I want to listen to my music ONLY and not some stupid suggested track, I can’t get out of it, because I used all of my skips on the DANG SUGGESTED TRACK! Fix that please! 

I’m sorry if that is all jumbled. But PLEASE fix it. I have seen the other users complaints, and it looks like most of us are having the EXACT same problem. Smh. If you made it this far. FIXX THEMM.

Spotify,2020-06-09 00:12:50,Love it but....,5,"Why I like this app: I like it how you guys have  made playlists and let us just pick a song and not just shuffle play well... most of them. Also you don’t have too be premium too use this app ( and please keep it like that because some people don’t have enough money or just don’t wanna waste it on something you should be able too use free).

Why I don’t like about this app: first is how you can’t  just pick a song from a playlist and not have limited skips, I think that’s kinda weird to not be able to play a song you wanna hear from your playlist. Now I wanna talk about the adds, let’s just say it’s irritating like when your listening too a song and just randomly get this add that says. “Watch this short add for 30 mins of add free music” then when I hit “no thanks” a add plays like do y’all do this to make more money or just to be irritating 😐😑🙄 like c’mom can we just get no adds!?!?!? And just buy premium for better quality, limited skips, and just pick songs from playlists and not wait 1 hour for 6 skips? Like really the only thing you should get premium for is better quality and limited skips! Like can we have some freedom?!

Look this just my opinion about this app so don’t get mad😅😅😅",😂😄😃

Spotify,2022-12-25 16:29:28,Decent,4,"This app is pretty good, but I wish you could select songs (not have to listen on shuffle every time) and listen offline without paying. It’s really annoying when you want to play a song so you search it up but the result is a playlist including the song and because it’s a playlist, you have to listen on shuffle and you also have limited skips so you can’t skip to the song you want. You have to pay for unlimited skips and to select songs. If you do want to select a song that you’ve been listening to, the “Daily Mix” playlists allow you to do that but there’s no guarantee that the song you want is in one of those playlists. It would also be great if you didn’t have to add like 10 songs to a playlist for the app to jot add random song to your playlist. It has to add more song to the playlist to be able to play in shuffle, but if it just DIDNT MAKE YOU LISTEN ON SHUFFLE FOR EVERYTHING, then bam, no random songs in your playlists. But another tip for being able to select songs, listen on a computer. You can select your songs easily and when you search up a song you can select it. You do not have to play your playlists on shuffle on a computer. There are also unlimited skips and less ads.",carrotweatherfan🌦

Also, i cant make an album with a few songs, it adds a bunch of ""recommended songs"" like no, i only want these songs that i put in, wnd if i try to delete the song, it adds another song. I have tried over and over again to find the song ""good 4 you"" and it keeps showing albums that randomly pick the song before you, i remember when i could scroll through the songs of an album, now i cant, it just, wont let me, i dont know if its something wrong with my settings, s glitch, or a annoying update but its annoying me when im trying to relax or something and listen to music, and when i cannot repeat the song, sometimes i wanna repeat a song over and over again, now im forced to watch another 30 songs and spend an hour trying to find the song on another album, witch never works.

Basically I thought premium was just no adds whatsoever and well..that was dumb lol. Today my trial ended٫ and i found out I would only get to skip songs 6 times per hour, and the audio quality would not be as good. Why. I get the adds and all, and that you need to make money out of the app, but these kinds of restrictions are just forcing you to get premium. At least make it more than just 6 skips per hour!! Like, I love Alec Benjamin, but his songs can be a little inappropriate. Same with Rex Orange Country, bcs he can curse. If I’m listening to music with my little brothers and I have to suddenly stop playing it, what am I supposed to do? I’d have already used my 6 skips and can’t just be like “ok little bro guess I’m turning off my music.” He’s gonna be confused for sure. Oh and the fact they are making the audio quality not as good is outrageous. Why would you make the music quality not as good?

I’ve used the app for years now and this only really started happening a year ago or at least like 6 months ago. But songs that I’ve played a lot ie the songs I really like just don’t play. Or it takes a couple tries for them to start, going back and forth between a song I start to play, just so I can try to try start the song I actually want to hear, and the song I really want to listen to can just be annoying. I feel like I put up with it for long enough that some of the songs that I had no issues with before are now completely locked. I really don’t want to happen to my current favorite songs because it just makes me switch away from my favorite genres and find something that while being good doesn’t have the same sort of liveliness of true discovery. Instead it’s a bit of a feeling of relief like making it out school when it’s evacuated. That may not be the best way to look at it though, a little insensitive if anything else, but I’m just trying to say that it’s forced. It’s not something that I want or need to do, and the thing that’s making me have this musical exodus is the fact that my songs aren’t playing properly.",MudStainedWall

There are just the tiniest things that kinda bug me when making playlists. I love the fact we finally got the ability to import images on mobile, it’s made it so much easier to make an aesthetically pleasing(?) playlist, but sometimes I get bothered by the fact that, if I DO decide to import an image, sometimes the background color for my playlist is like puke green. Idk how the app chooses the colors for each playlist, but I think it’d look a lot better if you just gave us a color wheel to choose our own color. I also wish it was easier to search for music (with lyrics or even different variations of the song name) multiple times have I been searching for a song using either, the one verse of the song I remembered, or a botched song name. Usually, if I remember any of the lyrics it will show up. Somehow it feels like every time I look up a song name and there’s even one word wrong, it won't show up. Once again idk how any of these things work so it could be an easy fix or even something you’ve been working on. I just came here to say my things I guess.",flameheadboy

Wayyy better selection than what I have tried so far....but, I find the “suggested” songs to be very annoying. The songs that are played are nothing close to the music that I listen to and even when I click the “hide the song” button, the same songs are played again! If this app is supposed to be so great that it suggests songs based on what I listen to, I would want it to take the songs that I hide into consideration as well. Also, don’t suggest songs that are part of a genre that I obviously do not listen to! If anything, please allow me to hide the artists and genres that I do not want to appear on any of my suggested songs lists. Everyone has preferences on what they listen to and what they would rather not listen to. Even for people who are not paying for the unlimited skips, the least you could do would be to allow us to not be forced to listen to songs that we cannot stand. It just makes the app very unattractive to potential customers. I’m too scared to pay for the subscription because I cannot control how the app suggests songs like this. I want to just listen to the playlists that I have created without worrying about having songs being inserted randomly. Please fix this.",N1kk133
Spotify,2021-08-13 09:28:17,trouble with the app,2,"So to get started I’ve had this app since 9th grade and not even when I had my iPhone 6 Plus did it give me issues like the app not working for me. Currently I have the iPhone 12 Pro But in the past couple of days I can’t use it at all, meaning I can’t scroll/interact with the app. I can’t choose a playlist, I can’t search for a song, I can’t play a song. I’ve done everything that I’ve seen online, tried logging out well the app doesn’t respond, so I did the best next thing which was uninstalled. I uninstalled the app and proceeded to log in again it work and I was able to play a song, but just 15 seconds of the song before it stopped and the app went unresponsive like it previously was. I turned off my phone I thought that would help, when I turned it back on and tried using the app it was the same thing. I ended up resetting my phone, entering my iCloud and dealing with all of the starting “new” for the app to not work. Please can a developer help me fix the issue or at least advice me on what to do next? I seriously love the app, but if I can’t get it to work I will have to cancel my subscription for it and get Apple Music instead because listening to music is one of the things I do the most.

Spotify,2019-07-03 00:59:13,3 Simple Fixes to Get Back to 5 Stars,3,"1. You need to include an alphabetical quick scroll on the right-hand side of all of your lists, whether it’s your list of playlists, your Artist Library, or inside an actual playlist looking at songs. No one has the time to swipe for 30 seconds to the bottom of their library when they want to listen to The Who. A quick scroll has been a standard on every music app for years now. Get with the times!

2. The artist library page needs a royal update. Or retro-date, rather. I had an older version of the app until yesterday where all artists whose music you had saved into your library displayed on the same library in a neat, clean fashion, regardless of whether or not you Follow them. Now you can only neatly organize those artists whom you Follow, and the rest are left in this awkward, disorganized list of artists with a big “Follow” button next to it. We know what you’re doing guys. If we want to follow an artist, we will. For now, just let us organize our artist library in a straightforward fashion.

3. Another retro-date: put back the option to view your Songs Library. Sometimes you just wanna shuffle your songs. Yeah, the “Liked Songs” playlist is there, and that’s cool and all, but it’s not intuitive when you have “Playlists” and “Artists” listed up top. Put it back.",aproctor8
Spotify,2021-03-23 01:18:53,Pretty good but...,4,"It’s a pretty good app, you can get a lot of music and make your own playlists so that’s nice. It also has good sound quality and does it’s best to stabilize sound so you don’t get really jarred by the start of a new song. 
My complaints are that there is a bug that just stops your music even when your internet connection is great. It often happens when your phone screen is locked, and sometimes when you open your phone and go to the app it has completely crashed, other times it has just paused it for some reason.
 My other complaint is more trivial, and it is about the auto play of recommended songs. I understand that the app is designed to act like a radio station, where you can’t really choose which songs you play and some will be played that are relating to the genre. However, I just really hate this feature, especially when I am playing songs from a artist that I really like however it is in a genre that I generally hate. Ideally the recommend song would be close enough to the artist’s style that the user might like the song as well even though they don’t like the genre, however that hasn’t been the case yet for me.

Other than my two complaints, this app is pretty great and I recommend it.",catzlovs12
Spotify,2022-09-11 18:51:40,It tracked my location…that’s kinda freaky,2,"Ok so I took a one week vacation to Virginia and about 4 days in I noticed I was getting ads to become a lifeguard at Virginia Beach…I live a good nine hours away from there so that means it tracked my location. I don’t remember ever allowing it to do this. I mean I got ads for my home state before but I never thought anything of it. It took it about 3 days after I got home before the ads switched back to my home state. To be honest I was kind of freaked out about this… Other than that this app was pretty good. I mean there were long ads that occurred frequently and you couldn’t skip them. But other than that I liked it. Wish I would have been made aware that it tracks my location though..

Edit: So ads are now getting ridiculous :/ I don’t use this app as often as I used to so I’ve noticed when I get on I get more ads. I just got 5 one minute ads in a row after just listening to one song. When I first got this app I loved the ad system because it would give you an ad and then give you 30 minutes of ad free listening. Now it gives you multiple ads in a row after pretty much every song. I realize that it has to have ads since it is the free version but this is overkill. I do wish if they were going to give such long ads that there could be an option to skip it.",canarylarry
Spotify,2022-11-09 03:23:03,Please fix the new home page interface!,5,"This app has, by far, been my most used app for years. But recently there has been one change that I greatly dislike and it’s very frustrating. The new home interface has made it extremely hard to find new music or music similar to the stuff I listen to. It’s just a bunch of random playlists of stuff I’ve usually already heard. It’s not useful at all. It’s actually quite counterproductive. I can’t jump back in to albums, playlists or artist either. It’s just an eternal scroll of random stuff. And if I want to look at songs I’ve been playing the most recently or any playlist like that, I have to go search for it in other pages. It’s very disappointing and it would be awesome if you guys could rectify this situation.
On another note, I can only press the green shuffle button one time and if I want to reshuffle have to go out of the playlists press something else and then go back in. It’s very frustrating, especially for someone like me who was hundreds, sometimes thousands of songs on my playlists (yes I am very obsessed with music 😂). Please fix these things.",Ranpo77

I'm just trying to listen to a song that could only be found on this app and as I said before we can't loop it, I even tried adding it specifically to it's own playlist but it added like 8-9 other songs.

All I'm saying is just give us something, something to at least work with.....I was going to buy premium but now I feel it's not worth it and I should just stick to SoundCloud like I was before.

I try restarting my phone, PC, anything, and it keeps screwing up. I’ve tried everything. For real, fix your bugs and don’t put the old bugs into a new update, PLEASE.

Not to mention, for non premium users, fix the ad problem. There’s definitely great ideas, but they are executed quite poorly. It’s clear that you want people to pay to do anything. And really, you shouldn’t even be plaguing them with ads if premium has just as many. 6 hours for each skip? There are 24 hours in a day. You’re telling me they only get FOUR SKIPS EVERY 24 HOURS? Seriously, that’s just downright disgusting and rude at that point. If you’re going to torment them like that, at least make it so it’s 2 additional skips per every 12 hours they wait, otherwise it’s just repetitive.

Anyways, remember that UI says a lot too. And you should also add the shortcuts back. They were quite useful. And once again, fix the bugs before sending out a new update because it’s annoying.

Usually this happens when my phone isn’t even on. (Like if the screen timeout goes off.) This problem is so annoying, probably more annoying then the adds not gonna lie.

The app is up to date and on top of these songs but it is a pain to work with. An app should always be user friendly and easy to understand but this isn’t it. I don’t like too much music and don’t know that many singers so when it made me choose three that’s a big no, it messed up my recommendations and I’m stuck with sicko mode as a recommendation because I was joking around. The app doesn’t allow you to play just one song, you have to make a playlist and if it’s not big enough it plays “recommended” music which is extremely irritating. Skipping songs only 6 times per hour is ridiculous and only there to make you pay money. Also the fact that you can’t restart your playlist after you’re done and it starts playing other music is uncalled for. I tried everything from looking it up and restarting my phone. Nothing worked. Ik there are hard core fans who know all the ins and outs of this app but that’s not the point, anyone (within reason) should be able to use and app, if they can’t then there is no point to download this app. Lastly I forgot to mention but not being able to add whole albums is also irritating, adding song by song is meticulous.",Loven dis app

I used to like that when if on the ""Your Library"" tab you could click on a recently played artist or just an artist from the ""Artists"" tab and it would take you only to the songs you saved from them, but then if you clicked on them from the ""Home"" tab it would take you to their main profile page. Now it takes you to their main page even if you click on the artist from the library tab. It's extremely inconvenient, I would like to listen to only the songs I have saved from an artist not all of them. Before the update at least we had the choice. And as dramatic as this sound I have to agree with other people, it really IS enough to make me want to delete the app because of how inconvenient it has actually become to listen to my saved songs. 

Also the layout is just kinda weird. Well not weird but the one before was definitely better. It had your recently played artists or albums or whatever it is you listen to. And now it's not really like that anymore. Now you gotta go to them from the ""Home"" tab.

It's literally a joke that I have to turn it on every time I pick a new song. What confuses me is the fact that repeat stays on when shuffle turns off. That needs to be fixed. Another thing is the fact that you can't hide the recommended songs that are at the bottom of each playlist. Which tends to always have the same songs on it. Which is quite annoying. Another thing is that when you search for something on a playlist, you cannot slide to the right to add to queue anymore. Which is a major time consumer now. A guy should be able to add to queue in a lot faster time than having to click song options, scroll down, and add to queue, because if there's multiple songs you'd like to add, it should take 10 seconds to add 10 songs. Not 10 seconds to add just one song. One more topic is that I have to go through multiple screens just to go to queue. Whom ever had that idea is considerably unintelligent. It used to be so simple and easy to use. Now it's like you're playing a intelligence and patience game with every user. With this new update, many things became very unnecessarily complex. My patience with this app is going quickly. I hope you fix these format issues.",Corndog3135
Spotify,2020-10-15 21:54:05,It’s great but..,4,"So I started using it because I didn’t need to have a subscription to use it freely unlike Apple Music which I used for awhile then cancelled the subscription I had. It’s kinda confusing like you can’t really save stuff. Also, the 6 skips an hour thing is annoying too! so I understand it’s most likely to keep the app free and all. but when I made my account it said I could listen with infinite skips and ZERO adds for free nothing about the seven day free premium trial! But no no no life isn’t that simple so basically I download it on my phone for the first time (I made my account on a computer so I could listen to music at school also I still had Apple Music at the time of making the account) and then this notification pops up that my seven day free trial has expired. Oh and this is right after I had texted my mom that’s it completely free! But we could have totally avoided this problem if the developers would just flipping fix their stupid app, and not say that with an account you can “listen completely free with no adds and infinite skips” cause that’s a lie. And don’t reply back to me saying “ That’s not true we say something about the trial!” Because then you’ll be lying even more!😡😡😡",Sailor-Cat
Spotify,2019-11-30 17:57:32,Please fix this,3,"This app was amazing, loved it so so much. There are few problems though,1.  it is very difficult to turn shuffle play on and off and it is difficult to know when it is on and when it isn’t. It would be great if there was a way to fix this. 

2. The new update totally screwed the app up, it isn’t worth it anymore, I’m more motivated not get the premium but rather to just go to another app. The library layout is terrible, very difficult to find what you are looking for. Hate it with a passion, and you put a limit to how many songs you can skip without premium? Another issue: when looking through songs, you can’t just pick a song to play and start the playlist from there, it only plays part of the song. Maybe I’m doing some gin wrong there, but it’s terrible now. 

The ads I don’t really mind, annoying, but fine whatever, the layout in the library/playlist is terrible, the shuffle button is broke, and you can only skip so many songs. And I cannot play songs without shuffle. Please please fix the library layout, skipping thing, and how I can only play songs on shuffle. I don’t even want to bother with this app anymore. Before this update, I had no complaints what so ever. Other than the issues listed, amazing app!",RoyalMarz
Spotify,2023-02-03 04:42:10,"Amazing app, but a few critiques…",4,"Lots of amazing songs to choose from and it’s really easy to make playlists and find what music you like best. Although, sometimes when trying to listen to a specific song or artist it will recommend you a song based off of what you are listening to. Although it’s nice to branch out sometimes it’s also important to me to listen to the music I wanna hear in the moment and not similar songs. I also think that for the price premium is set at it’s not exactly worth the money. They could give more opportunities to interest more people into buying premium and not just what’s already given. Also, on some less commonly streamed songs they do not include lyrics like they would with popular songs. I get that it might be difficult to add lyrics but they should give smaller artists the same privileges as larger and more commonly known ones. Overall it’s still a great app and I love to use it to listen to both music,podcasts, and subliminal to help with sleep. There is so many different options for what you might want to listen to in the moment and I would still recommend this app to listen or publish what you like.",Beth Duberry
Spotify,2020-12-08 20:39:00,My music suddenly stops playing and ads,2,"I’ve been having this issue for awhile and it’s getting on my nerves. Sometimes when I’m listening to my music, it just suddenly stops playing and when I go back to play it again, it plays from the beginning. It’ll suddenly stop playing half way through the song and when I go back to press play again, the music starts from the beginning. It’s been doing that for about a few months now and at first I thought it was maybe my headphones, but just today I wasn’t using them and the music stopped again. I’m getting really tired of this happening. Also, when it does stop and goes to the beginning, I just skip to the next song on my playlist, but then again, it does the same thing to the next song. I want this to stop! It’s super annoying and I just want to listen to my music without any problems. 

Also, when ads pop up, it gives you the option to skip them and go straight to your music. I always skip them because, to be honest, your ads are super annoying. I just close out of the app and go back in it again to play music. However, sometimes when I do skip the ads, it still plays an ad. Like, it SUPER ANNOYING and I’m getting sick of it. It gives you the option and you decide to play it anyway. Not cool. Please get back to me ASAP!",Susanne Martinez
Spotify,2020-11-19 06:55:05,Great but...,5,"At the time of writing this, I have some annoyances with the app. Number one being that there is a major crashing problem with this app. I am pretty confident it is not my phone due to it still being fairly new (IPhone 8). At the moment I have counted the app crashing 8 times within the hour. I am on all of the latest app version and iOS. Another issue I have. You used to be able to go into an artist album and look at the songs and preview play them, now you can’t, this is extremely annoying when I’m trying to preview songs to add to my playlists. It was fine before but they are always changing it. Another issue I have are ads. There used to be 2-3 ads about every 30 minutes with the occasional “watch the video to get 30 minutes ad free” ad. Now, ads every 2-3 songs and when the watch video ad comes up, I still end up watching two more ads after the “so called” only video. The list goes on and on with things. This app was much better months ago but it is getting very out of hand. Looks like I’m switching to Apple Music I guess.",Toner_B
Spotify,2022-12-22 14:49:10,a few inconvenient things about the lyric appearances,3,"Spotify’s pretty great with the way it makes playlists and suggestions for you and the layout is nice. But you can tell that every song’s lyrics are done by different people because if there’s cuss words some put stars after the first letter, some don’t censor it, some censor the whole thing. and sometimes the lyrics are just incorrect. for example in “lost in the citadel” by lil nas x the correct lyrics are “my god, you’re an angel” but the lyrics say “my guardian angel”. i just wish they would keep everything consistent with lyric writing. just put the whole word for everything, you don’t need to censor words for a song that is already marked explicit. also there should be a feature like apple music where it focuses on one line at a time. and if they wanna be extra fancy they could have different settings for how you want your lyrics to appear. if i’m listening to a song and really like a certain line and wanna screenshot it, i would have to crop it or circle the words which isn’t as cool looking as having one line in focus at a time. but also that should be something users can change. more settings for the way lyrics appear would be cool.",Keira Wolfsea
Spotify,2022-09-29 06:28:52,The new Home Screen is terrible on Mobile,1,"Never written a review for anything but this has prompted me. I’ve been a premium user for a few years now on the mobile app and the Home Screen was as close to perfect as I could  have expected . I would use the top half of it 90% of the time and that was good enough because it would offer easy visual access to new music and recommendations. Very little scrolling was required due to the plethora of options that could be viewed at one time without scrolling. Now that everything is larger only 2 listening options are available to be viewed without scrolling. 2 options per scroll is a huge step backwards and it’s completely wasted space on the screen. I’m wasting time browsing through music I don’t care about when I was able to scroll twice in the past and find something interesting. The new format also randomly inserts music I’ve just listened to into the mix to fill space, which is frustrating and pointless. At least make the old format an option in the settings. This new format has made finding new music more difficult than ever and it’s unintuitive. By far the worst update the app has ever had. This isn’t going to bring anyone over from Apple Music or Pandora and I’m not sure who the target audience is for this. Senior citizens maybe?",tearsofaseacow
Spotify,2019-06-19 18:49:06,"great app, but annoying rollback of features in recent update",5,"This is a review about the recent change to ""Your Library"". Generally these changes are a substantial UI improvement and navigating between various views is far more intuitive now that the notion of a my library home page, with all relevant shortcuts to artists, podcasts,... only available there.

the only issues I’ve run into as of yet are 1. the lack of the a-z navigation scroll bar in the Albums section and 2. the lack of a move to front list of recently played albums. re 2. however, I feel this may actually be useful toward encouraging people to diversify their listening, as the design of defaulting to recently played in my experience makes it difficult to spend time finding something I’d like to listen to (either new or archived in my albums section) when my attention is already so contested by everything else. 

so yeah, I actually like what I said was my second complaint, and thinking back had thought about that before. being able to scroll quickly through the albums seems like a good interaction to keep, however.",PhoenixBirdCity
Spotify,2022-01-06 13:45:04,Okay but Very Infuriating,3,"This is a very good app for organizing and finding music without wasting too much battery. I use it every day and it does its job okay. My problem with this app is its ads. Yes, I know that you can get rid of ads by purchasing premium, but for those who don’t want premium their ad experience should be improved. I’ve been listening to the same ads on repeat for weeks. It gets tedious when I have the same nonsense spouted at me for hours worth of time. Another issue I have is the dislike ad feature. When you dislike an ad you shouldn’t hear it as often as you would normally right? But it seems as if this app hates me because when I dislike an ad it just plays it MORE often. Another issue, suggested songs. Suggested songs is a great feature, however, I’ve been having issues with it. I would be listening to a 3 hour long playlist, and only after hearing 9-10 songs off that playlist it would start suggesting songs. Songs should only be suggested after almost every song has played? So why am I hearing songs that I don’t want to listen too?
Overall this app drives me insane and I don’t think I can use it for much longer if this continues.",Zadolk
Spotify,2022-02-19 00:24:43,Honest opinion,5,"This app is very good, and pretty decent for the fact that it is free. I do not have too many complaints since it is free and if you are uncomfortable with the free version of the app, there is always the free version. One of my only complaints about the app is, when you search for an album and want to see more songs from a certain album, in the mobile version, you can't access the full album, and now you can't even see the songs that you yourself put on your playlist. What is the point of doing that??  Please fix that, it's useless. It is very annoying. 

Another complain I have is when your playlist ends, you get a radio recommending you songs that could match your taste. There is an option where you can see the songs you’ve listened to recently but when it comes to the radio songs, they’re never registered. I know the like button is an option but sometimes you’re busy and can’t really click the like button. It would be so much better if the recently played option expanded to the radio songs as well.",Fleuriiist

Spotify,2020-03-06 23:52:59,"Amazing amount of free music; could use some work on ""made for you"" playlists",4,"It's very easy to use, and has literally every song I've tried to find (including some extremely obscure ones). I only have two complaints. 
One is that in the playlists that the app creates for you, it tends to only play songs that you have already listened to multiple times (in shuffle lol) or popular, similar ones. If I follow an artist, there should be an option to mix their more obscure music with the popular stuff. If a playlist is ""made for me,"" it should be able to play whatever it is I like, whether it's a superstar's most popular hit songs, or the most obscure songs released by a guy with 500 listeners. It's not a radio station; it only has to cater to the tastes of one specific person.
Secondly, there should be a way to add, if not entire artists, then at least full albums to playlists that you're creating from the app. I follow over fifty artists, and if I like all of their music, I don't want to add all 3000+ of their songs individually. It wouldn't be a hard feature to add, and would make me actually likely to create a playlist or two.

It would help if playlist radio was something you’d voluntarily go to rather than the app just deciding for you. 
I also don’t like how there’s a specific folder just for getting premium on the mobile version because heck, you can’t even buy it from there, you have to go online and that just kinda defeats the purpose of putting a whole folder there. If you want to advertise it that bad, just put it somewhere else. 
Also, the ads are so loud! I get it, you want our attention, but how the heck am I supposed to listen to your “quality music” in premium if I lose my hearing while hearing an ad for it? Seriously, chill. 
I know that you’re only allowed 6 skips per hour as a non-premium member, but I’ve noticed that you have to be listening to music in that hour in order for that to happen, which is dumb. I use up my skips, get out of the car to work for about 7 hours, get back in to go home and my skips are still all out and I can’t do anything.

Spotify,2019-06-19 02:27:38,Save songs for premium,2,"I have a premium account and the new update changed the “saved songs” into “liked songs”. I don’t listen to a certain playlist I listen to my saved songs but now since the update songs that Iv had “saved” or “liked” before show that they have not been like either when you swipe left or actually go on the song and click the green heart. But it still shows up in my “liked music”. This makes me incredibly confused because I’m unsure if I actually have the song saved or not. Also there is no bar on the side of the screen that shows the letters in which you can find the song alphabetically which there was earlier when “liked songs” was “saved songs” this makes it difficult to find certain songs, because I can’t just go down to the letter anymore. Also with the shuffle on my “liked songs”, if my filter is on to sort by title and I click “shuffle play” usually the same four songs play.  I really thing the shuffling algorithm needs to be fixed because I’m not enjoying the other songs I want to listen on my “liked songs”. Moral of this is that this new update didn’t fix anything about the app but made it harder to use now that “liked songs” is treated as a regular play list and not songs that I have saved.",Juliana corner

One month ago it was just music and my like songs were like normal and like every time when I press on them, they play the whole song but now my liked songs when I press on them they only play like part of the song and I think that’s kind of weird because I like the old version better and sometimes when I’m shuffling my like songs and then when I press it, it kind of gets glitched out so I think if you just change the like songs back to normal, it would be good. This music app is really really fun just the last thing I want to say is it’s kind of like a question. Why can we only use six skips I love all the music. It’s just that now. When the like songs are changed. I skip a lot of songs, so maybe I have I think I have a good choice, it’s either like you can give us more skips or you don’t give us a skip limit at all.

Spotify,2020-01-16 00:27:00,Why not higher?,4,This app used to be the highest of my phone but with every update the layout of the app gets worse and worse. The current layout of just playlist is so inconvenient as opposed to the previous one where it would have your most recently played music laid out. The moving of the settings to the home screen makes changing the EQ and sound quality such a burden in comparison to what it was. Also I used to be able to go under the artist tab and even able to listen to all the songs I have saved from the artist specifically but now if I go I see ALL of the songs instead of the the saved despite being able to do that before. These last few updates have been rather reductive and if they continue to degrade I WILL find another app to use for my music. I highly recommend the company roll back some of its cosmetic changes to the app because they ARENT good changes. And also return some of the practical functions the app used to have like being able to listen and shuffle to specific saved song by artist instead of having to make an entire playlist just to be able to listen To one artist or one album.,Cmbsax5917Starwarsfan

However, the new differentiation between saved songs, albums, and artists is incredibly frustrating. If I unsave an album, all the songs are still saved (it just won’t show up in the album section). If I save a new single that is released, I have save the song and the “album” separately to get them to come up on both lists. On top of that, the artist page only shows who you follow, and it’s not like I even keep track of who’s music is saved on my phone (I’m close to 3000 songs).
I like to go to my most recent songs or most recent albums to set up playlists or my queue for a drive in the car, or maybe I want to shuffle all the songs I’ve saved by one artist because I’m in that mood. If I don’t want to play one album specifically, I can’t do that... and shuffling the artist page just isn’t the same. Unless there is some streamlining of this new system somehow to make this less obnoxious, I would MUCH rather go back to the old version.

Then you wouldn’t have that song by Japanese Breakfast. Think about that. I’d like to merge playlists, so I can select all the songs in one or more lists and add them to either an existing list or create a new list. If I make a listening queue, I’d like to save those songs as a playlist. (Think prime music.) Do you have any idea how tedious it is to create a playlist by adding one song at a time? I want to customize my playlist order in my library, so I can easily access my favorites without scrolling. I want to find playlists in my library by song. That way I don’t have to search through my 80 playlists to find one specific song. For example, if I type Sgt.

And then you try to make me pay ten dollars a month for it when I can just go on my school chrome book and I can change the songs. And I’m not going to bring that thing up every night to listen to music.
Anyways, an add came up while I was switching to the next song and it says that if you watch this add, which it was around thirty-five seconds, you get the next half hour free of adds. So I watch it and when that was done another add came up just to tell me that there was thirty minutes of no adds, it was about fifteen seconds long, it talked for literally four seconds and then the add just sat there for another eleven seconds showing me a picture of a product that I don’t even have enough money for.

I don’t like complaining about ads because I understand you have to make money somehow, but don’t you make money off of premium?

Spotify,2020-06-13 07:42:24,**edit** Update needs to be retconned **edit**,4,"They brought back the alphabet search feature in liked songs. If they bring back the old “artists” filter function where it lets you click on the artist and shows only the songs saved, by album this app will be a 5/5, but the side bar function immediately makes this app fun to use again. 

This update took away some basic functions that made the app convenient and easier to use. The letter based scroll in “liked songs” was an easy way to find certain songs I was looking for without having to either swipe until I find the song, or type out the song name until I found it. I also can’t go into an artists songs I have saved anymore. So if I want to listen to them I have to again search them and shuffle every song they have made. This  just elongates the process while also making it inferior to its predecessor. The changes to the app recently have felt rushed, Ill advised, and with no thought towards consumers. I can’t imagine I’ll be using this app much longer if their goal is to take away basic functions while making the app a complete garbage fire.",Mark.J.Myers 1st

What your getting is a play list made of things with the same genre as you like, things you add, and oh, a billion different songs that have nothing to do with what you like! And the whole “just press the skip button”, you only get 6 per hour. You want to listen to uninterrupted music, well look further because with a 30 second to 1 minute long add every 2 songs you’ll regret it! Now all this can be solved by purchasing the premium option. Or can it? On my friends phone she purchase the premium option and a day later we got an add about grocery outlet bargen market. 
   Now there are some nice things about it. Such as being able to have your phone off and still be able to listen, I love that. And being able to manage your account easily. But that’s it. I got a ratio of 2 goods per 5 bads. Thanks for listening to the whole review. It’s still better than you tube music 🎵😊",hounest anna (on ah)
Spotify,2022-10-31 04:04:55,"Great app, but there are always problems",4,"One example I’ve always had with this app is that when I swipe to like a song or add it to the queue, sometimes it selects a different song in the same playlist/album. Sometimes this even happens when adding a song to another playlist. Very frustrating. I’m also curious why the ‘not interested’ feature was removed. This app has a problem with recommending albums I’ve listened to many times or going back to the same handful of albums to recommend. Sometimes it’ll keep those in the recommended for months at a time. I thought the ‘not interested’ feature would help fix that when I realized it was a feature. But it was removed shortly after. Also, I would love if the home page had at least some consistency. I want my recently played to be there always. I use that to store my ‘listen later’ albums. Right now, my recently played row is gone and I can’t access it. I would also love if what is popular wasn’t pushed on my home page so much. I don’t listen to a single one of any of those artists and I’m not interested.",Thenachokiller
Spotify,2019-07-03 16:32:08,what’s with the new way of categorizing saved music?,1,"when i save an individual song, i still want that song to be FINDABLE. if i wanted to put it into a playlist with thousands of songs, id do that. but with the previous versions of the app, you could find ANY saved album under the albums category. even if i just have one or two songs saved from an album, i want it to be there! because otherwise it’s just lost in a sea of thousands of individually saved songs. with the previous versions, you could filter out entire albums if you CHOSE to, but now that’s the default. i have no clue why yall keep making updates that antagonize your loyal users. it’s one thing to change up the design or add cool new features or fix existing issues, but it’s another to just remove an entire means of categorizing music??? and, for what reason? out of an assumption that people who save individual songs only want to listen to their music on shuffle, and never would want to actually be able to find their liked songs in a functional way? it’s stupid. please make it so that all liked music is represented under the albums category again, even if the entire album isn’t saved. it’s really annoying to see HUNDREDS of albums disappear from that category just because i only saved some songs from them.",tessssssssssssssssssssss
Spotify,2019-06-30 06:19:32,Here’s the thing...,4,"I LOVE THIS APP. Seriously such an amazing app to use to listen to music of all types. I love how it personalizes playlists for you based on what you’ve been listening to, what’s on your rotation. I love creating playlists and finding songs that are recommended for me. However, the new interface is not great. I really liked how the platform looked before the most recent update. Now my songs are not in alphabetical order (making it hard to look for a song to play without searching the song, which means it won’t continue with my library after that song I searched), I can’t seem to find the specific section for radio listening (which could be my own stupidity but still help please), I also feel like my personalization either disappeared or changed. For whatever reason, it is playing songs in my library that I either rarely listen to or it’s not catching onto the vibe I’m going for. For example, It used to play country songs more than other genres if it noticed I was listening to more country than other stuff. Now it just seems all over the place. Love the app, just not the new update.",okayyrosee
Spotify,2019-03-15 00:17:12,iPhone XR Update is horrible,1,"Last week, the XR received an update that essentially broke the experience for me. All of my saved artists are no longer there, and my “Artists” tab only shows artists I’ve “followed,” and takes me to the artists’ page and not the albums or songs I have saved. The interface is completely different. I chatted on their website with support for over two hours, only to have the person tell me that the feature I have used every day for years never existed . This is a basic function since the inception of the MP3 player. 

I have been a premium subscriber for more than 5 years, and this has made me seriously consider other streaming services. I have over 10,000 songs that I’ve saved or “liked” over the years, and to only be able to sort by album or song is terrible. Not to mention, BEFORE the update, it was a pain to navigate the Artists page because there is no scroll bar or alphabet to the side to help you navigate - you would have to scroll past hundreds of artists to get to the one you wanted if you wanted to listen to a band that started with “T.”

This doesn’t seem to be a problem on any other iPhones, but the latest update affected my desktop app on my work computer, as well. When this is fixed, I’d gladly adjust my review back to 5 stars.",John1681
Spotify,2020-07-25 07:07:22,I like it but,4,"I do really like the app, because i can listen to some songs without having to somehow pay them, and I really like that. It was going very well until I decided to press the shuffle play button a few times ,because I was kinda curious, and it just messed up my playlist of liked songs. For example, on of the songs I liked  was called “Gone Forever”, and while playing this song with I didn’t have a problem with it, it’s just let’s me play the whole song. But when I pressed the shuffle play button, it’s doesn't let me play the song, it just plays a few seconds of it then goes to the different song. And it’s not just one song, three or more songs are like that. Playing with other songs the app provided me however did work until I was skipping the songs, wanting to know if it can play “gone forever”, but couldn’t get to it because of the premium. So I tried that again but it didn’t work this time. I don’t know how to fix this and I tried looked how to fix this but there wasn’t a clear answer.  I hope you see this message and hope that you can somehow help me on this",ndjejsjs
Spotify,2019-04-21 03:31:24,"It’s a great app, but the update is making me angry!",1,"The idea of the app is great, but...  I have 3 complaints. The first would be that it’s excruciatingly irritating when I just want to listen to a few specific songs on a little playlist, and then it automatically adds some songs I don’t want to listen to. I mean, seriously?! I had no freaking complaints at all about the app before this. I just want to be able to listen to exactly what I want, exactly when I want to. 
     I understand that maybe some people don’t find this very annoying, but, I do. So, if you made it to where you could turn off the automatically adding songs in settings, then, that would be wonderful. 
       My second complaint is that only having shuffle play vexes me. I just want to listen to whatever I want and not be bothered by anything else (besides ads, I will tolerate those and I know that you need them in order to make money). Anything else as in songs I don’t want to hear.
        My third and final complaint is that I miss being able to play 1 song over and over again. 
         That’s all I’ve got. And, my rating might seem a little harsh for something so trivial, but, that’s just how annoyed I am about this. So, if you could just please fix all of this in your next update, that would be much appreciated!",Puyopie :3

I don’t have premium, it’s really expensive like… Here is everything that is making me not want to use this app Skips: There should be unlimited skips, it’s annoying that i can’t skip ahead to a specific song Playlists: It’s SOO annoying that you can’t just pick a song to listen to. you have to pick a playlist and wait for the song to play, or play the song and have it shuffled in with completely random songs. Playing Ends: it’s so annoying that when you are done with your list, it plays random stuff again. i also hate that if you want to start the list over, you can’t for an hour and it plays random songs. Making Playlists: It’s very inconvenient that you have to search the song, put it on the list, and then it takes you out again. you should be able to do a bunch of songs or even an album at once. I also Hate that you have to watch an add to listen, and there is adds like every 2 songs.

Spotify,2021-10-31 00:21:32,Ads,4,"I don’t know exactly why but, It will give me a ad saying “listen to this ad for 30minutes free of ads” Then have a 10 second ad after but even AFTER those ads after 1-2 songs it will give another advertisement. And continues to do that after every 1-2 songs which gets highly annoying when your just trying to relax and listen to your playlists which then gets me on the subject that when you create a playlist if it doesn’t have enough songs it will add in random songs which is very confusing because they aren’t even related to the album or type of music you have in this playlist. Otherwise this app is great the audio is clear and perfect you can use Bluetooth I love the fact that you can turn your iPhone off and it still plays or if I’m listening to songs in my playlist and someone texts me I can click on it and as I’m typing the music is still playing In the background which is nice you don’t have to go pause and play it every second.

I want to thank my studio friend Cynthia for helping me out and for giving me lots of strength and the support that I needed to move forward. 🙂 their was a dance from my studio called singing in the rain and I remember it now because I’m 22 years old it was a suggestion track so I did it.

Spotify,2021-02-21 15:44:27,New update,3,"Hello! I love this app a lot because of its playlist ability but I do not like the new update. In the update they changed how playlists work and how the artist areas and songs are played. My main problem with the new update is the fact that you can’t play the songs you have inside a playlist you can only play the playlist and it will shuffle through the songs you have in that playlist. Most of the time when I use a playlist I categorize songs that make me feel a certain way so when I’m feeling that emotion I can go into that playlist and listen to the song I want; however with the new update I can’t pick which song I start with and it really annoys me. I also hate all the new options and how much guess work has to happen. I much prefer the old set up and navigation to the new one and would like there to be some kind of settings option to go back to the old version or to just scrap this dumpster fire of a new set up all together.

To any readers of this I’m sorry if a lot of what I said was repeated or doesn’t make sense I’m not the best at expressing how I feel about something through words I just really needed to talk about how much I hate this update.",MagicaOfKoning
Spotify,2019-06-29 18:13:27,Liked tracks PLEASE READ THIS AND FIX THIS,2,"I thought I liked the new update until I tried to listen to specific artists in my liked tracks (used to be saved tracks until the update). Now, every time I search an artist in my liked tracks and I try to shuffle, it goes to random artists when I specifically search one particular artists name. I don’t like that it’s treating the liked tracks like a playlist. I always like to listen to specific artists in my liked tracks including their features but now I can’t!! Please fix this. How else am I supposed to listen to specific artists in my liked tracks?? There is no way I’m creating a playlist from my liked tracks for each artist. I used to be able to go to my liked tracks, search in somebody’s name and it would filter to the list of only that person and their features and I could keep shuffling through and it was stay on that artist. Now when I do that and try to shuffle it doesn’t stick and it pulls in the whole library of liked tracks which I don’t want!!!!!

I see that if you follow an artist it up pulls all of their songs you have liked into a playlist but It doesn’t include the songs they’re featured on!!!! Please fix this, this is enough to make me switch platforms.",Daboo1
Spotify,2019-06-27 18:23:19,App is nearly worthless unless you organize your music through playlists alone.,2,"Previous updates ruined the organization of albums. Now the most recent update has eliminated organization of your music by artist. Also instead of having a ‘liked songs’ library, it is now a playlist called ‘liked songs’. That’s not detrimental but it seems mighty dumb and pointless. 
My biggest gripe is with the ruining of the artists library tab. Instead of showing artists you have music saved from, it shows artists you follow (i don't follow any because it seems redundant to both save an artist’s music AND follow them around). Below your followed artists, it has recommended artists based on what you listen to but even if you select those, it will play songs by the artist that you haven't saved. So now it seems that the only way to listen to only the songs you like from a specific artist without the songs you didn't save is to create a playlist with those songs alone. Entirely defeating the purpose of any part of this app other than playlists. I dont really listen to music by playlists, i prefer to listen by artist (not every song by the artist, just the songs by the artist i like) so this app is pretty useless at this point.",Tim40017384@6027288

Spotify,2019-06-19 22:14:23,Update Tanked User Experience,5,"“Recently played” was a great feature for people who only listen to albums and not playlists. Once you have a hundred or so artists, hundreds of albums, and thousands of songs in your library rooting through them on a daily basis is untenable. Previously I could just see the last 20 or so albums I played in an easy to use screen that was basically the landing pad for “your library”. This was basically what I used to decide what to listen to on a daily basis. Aside from being moved it now uses a large tile format that requires much more scrolling for the same information. Really inconvenient when im driving and trying to change albums. Most importantly though it cant be edited. So now if I listen to 4 or 5 one offs I can’t delete them to keep my most favored albums in tact. I have to wait for them t roll off and can never retrieve the albums they bumped from the list. So what was previously a mostly automated process had now become something I will have to track manually, which makes me want to cancel the service.",Guilicious
Spotify,2022-12-09 21:03:25,I would love to give this app 5 stars But…,4,"I love the app. I’ve spent about 5,000 hours on it this past year. There’s just ONE feature I hate. When you make a playlist it has a habit of adding it’s own songs after you’ve run through them all. For instance I recently created a Christmas playlist because there are only a few Christmas songs I actually enjoy and if I wanted to listen to any Christmas music I’d turn on the radio. So I created the playlist with a handful of songs it is about an hour long playlist to get through them all but when it has finished the list instead of starting over or just stopping instead it starts playing OTHER Christmas songs that’s NOT on the playlist. I don’t care if you THINK I’ll enjoy it because I was just listening to the same genre of it isn’t on my playlist DONT PLAY IT!!!! It’s that simple. Other than that problem it is great just don’t expect to only hear songs on your playlist you create because I don’t have that problem when I’m listening to a playlist someone else or even the app made just the ones I created.!",SlyWitin
Spotify,2021-02-13 11:56:09,Wish it offered more,4,"I ABSOLUTELY love this app. The algorithm is amazing, I love the music that I’ve discovered by the radios and recommended. I love the interface it’s pretty easy to get used to and to navigate. I also love the eq mixer on the app. However i hate that for a music app, it doesn’t offer a higher quality music for audiophiles. I personally don’t get this decision, I have loved this app for so long, but the more I go on it, the more I fall in love with music. This naturally evolved to wanting higher quality music and I was disappointed to learn how low Spotify’s quality really is. I have been a premium memeber for a long time, and I had to switch over to Tidal for my higher quality streaming. I would much rather pay extra for Spotify’s algorithm, interface, streaming options if they were to add a lossless or cd quality memberships. It was with a heavy heart that I had to cancel my subscription purley based on this. I have bought a great system that could support this quality for a lot of money, I also now pay almost 30$ for Tidal and I would much rather spend my money here than there.",mnehwh
Spotify,2020-05-14 14:49:31,"Great app, has one big problem",3,"This a a really great music streaming app. I have a free account and use this app all the time.
My one peeve is the ""Similar songs"" feature (or problem, depending on where you come from). I listen to a very set group of songs, because there is some music out there that I think is a little crude. Yes, I have the ""no explicit songs"" feature turned on, but I'm pretty strict with what I like. I don't like how when I listen to an album, the app will start to play songs from some totally different band. I look through what songs are in the album, and the one that's playing is not on the list.
If I want to find new music I'll go look for it. I don't want to be doing my schoolwork, listening to songs that help me stay focused, and all of a sudden get distracted by wondering what the heck this song is.
I have the ""Don't play other songs when album is finished"" set to 'on', but this is coming smack within the middle of the album. I haven't listened to all the songs yet. 
If you guys can fix this ""playing suggested track"" problem, this would be a hands down five-star app. But the suggested tracks are really that much if a problem, so for now its three stars.",TrueReviewer02

The “tap now to watch a short video for 30 mins of ad free music” link doesn’t always work. Or yesterday I watched the ad then proceeded to hear two more ads right after, heard two songs, then three more adds. I get that I have the free version and I’m fine with the adds once in awhile but if you’re going to say do this thing to not hear ads then play them anyway, that’s misleading and makes me not want to use this app. Also, on occasion songs with just stop playing in the middle. The screen says it’s playing, but it isn’t. Only way to fix that is to exit out of the app then reopen. Super inconvenient when listening in the shower....

Spotify,2018-09-26 02:03:29,Amazing App!,5,"All I can say is this app is positively amazing. It is made very nicely, and although it does have an occasional advertisement, that does not possibly amount to the overall amazing quality. Definitely worth getting the premium membership feature (I don’t own it, but have used it before with a close friend of mine.) This app is a must-have if you have a busy lifestyle and love listening to music!
  One of my favorite features is the playlist option. You can make customized playlists to your music preference. It’s positively amazing!
  You can also add certain artists you like, and it customizes your daily mixes.
  Another great feature is the daily mixes! The app gives you daily playlists based on your favorite songs and artists, and makes a personal playlist based on the aforementioned favorite songs and artists.
  Altogether, it is a spectacular app that has MANY amazing features, and I’m not surprised it is so popular and successful. I hope everyone can notice the amazing quality and effort that was put into the making of this AMAZING app!",Raveiin (SM)

I use can move a new song to the top well you can’t do that anymore. So I have to start a new playlist and add them in the order I want this will not do . I copied to a 3 party program that will let me. It’s a backup I always Used. If you spend years making your playlist you may want to do the same . I don’t want to go down over a 500 long playlist to hear my best new stuff. The 3rd party program copy’s songs to do it but you do what you got to. I like the people getting paid but why take control from the users ? Anyways here is my old review I’m starting to think is this with ads to find new music and just make your own playlist using your way. You have new music Friday but some times I can’t get to it and when I hit download and save list it updates to the next new music Friday.

Some songs I need to listen to them again and I don’t want to right away add them to a playlist!

Why can I not see radio/recommended songs when I click on “songs recommended”? Literally who in their right mind ASK to try to see the radio and we see the SEARCH BAR? Literally no one. Who asked for the hearts to be taken away so we would have a harder time adding songs to the basic liked songs playlist? Literally no one. And y'all are still being dragged for overall having a bad radio variety and playing the same 50 songs. In my opinion, radio should be based on not only the artist played, but also caring more about the genre it's under rather than popularity and playing the same 5 people. People thought paying premium would make listening on the app less insufferable but I guess not. I still like the app but seriously?

I had to re-download songs so much times it’s getting to a point where I’m going to find another music app and look for the same offline use feature and get that one if it offers to not have the songs easily deleted. I suggest. Once all the songs you want downloaded is on the phone, have it set-up to where you have to hit a delete button on the song itself to delete it.

It’s the free version!” You are right. However, take this in consideration: 1) Why, why, why would I ever want a bunch of songs that I “might like” show up on my playlist instead of the songs that I actually put on my playlist? 2) There should be a play button for the regular shuffle function, AND a separate play button for when you want to continue the playlist. This goes back to the unwanted songs that are tacked onto a playlist. No matter what, it seems that one cannot reset the playlist unless they desire the unholy wait time of a whole day. 3) 6 skips is pretty skimpy. Now, if the only songs that showed up in your playlists were the ones you put in there, than I would be fine with it. BUT, when I have to skip through 6 suggested songs that I had no intention of listening to, that “I’m fine with it” turns into “I want to swallow straight horse dung for 24 hours.”

And it waits for about 10 seconds for you to click ‘watch video’ but now the woman says it, doesn’t wait, plays 3-4 ads in a row and doesn’t give 30mins. Fix this please!",Slurptalon3000
Spotify,2022-07-29 06:48:12,Premium is just stupid 😐,2,"I downloaded this app and it was grate but it lost three stars when I learned in order to truly just listen to my music I have to get the premium thing and it was so annoying cause a friend of mine has premium and most of his music doesn’t even play in areas with no signal even if it’s downloaded. And since I will never get the premium thing (sorry that I’m calling it premium thing 😐) every time I want to just look up a song I have to listen to an entire playlist as well and I may not even get to here the song I wanted to listen to. Honestly I don’t see why u can’t let us none premium people just search up a song and listen to it. Another thing which a lot of people probably hate is the ads. Sometimes I listen to two songs and I get 3 ads and two of them are 30 seconds and the other is 15 seconds. And all the ads that I get are SO annoying and stupid. So what I’m trying to say is at least let us none premium payers or whatever people like me are called who doesn’t use premium to at least have unlimited skips or shorter ads or just allow us to search up a song and listen to it, not a playlist.. please",ur mom is calling
Spotify,2021-11-28 00:12:36,That’s the music app I found so far… But,1,"My feedback in situations like this, for every app that holds me hostage for my opinion before releasing me to go about my business ,as I had planned, is evermore the same “Stop!“ Please show me the respect and common decency that I deserve by not hijacking my process and requiring me to answer a question before I can be free to complete my tasks. Please assume my intelligence and ability to find an use a “contact us” link to submit my suggestions and feedback should I choose to do so. I am extremely busy and have difficulty focusing on any one task in the midst of annoyances and distractions. It seems to me the reasonable question for your company would be: “do we want this individual using/exploring the benefits of our product or would we rather interrupt his thought process and cause him to forget what the heck he was trying to use it for in the first place, or would we rather have him click yes or no and then give us an answer that we won’t be actionable with anyway, and in this way end up with no changes to our annoying policies and now a potential upgrade gone, or a referral to new business is left feeling unappreciated and frustrated with nothing nice to say about the product?”",jcmarkhus
Spotify,2020-08-30 08:24:29,Miss the Old Version,1,"I understand limiting skips but I don’t get why when you shuffle a playlist of album on the phone app it constantly gives songs from random other artists. Doesn’t make any sense to me???? Honestly makes me want to not use the app. This is honestly so simple to change, the old app used to be much better. Another issue is that sometimes you can add songs to playlists when you click on them - you have to click on them in a playlist instead of straight up clicking which just takes extra time spent to search for a playlist. There are other small similar issues like this which just make the experience a bit worse which builds up to just be bad. 

The computer app is totally great - if the phone app could just have the same basic capabilities this would turn my rating to a 6/5. Please change it! I’m not even asking for more skips, I just want it to shuffle what I want it to shuffle, be able to click view more songs on an artist and actually view more songs, and actually be able to add the song to my playlists when I click it - also make the ability to add several songs to a playlist at one or one song to multiple playlists.

Spotify,2020-02-26 22:30:34,Great app but...,3,"It’s a great app to listen to music with all of the choices. There’s a lot of pros and cons about this. Some of the pros are that I’ve just this year have switched over from pandora. This doesn’t take along time to load and plays the songs right away when you have good WiFi. But moving on to some of the cons, I like to listen to music while I draw on long car rides. But it might take awhile to load. Also when ever I try to pause because someone is talking to me it also takes a while before it does. Same with when I want to continue listening to music. There’s also a lot of stuff trying to recommend premium. Like when I try to hook it up to the tv I like I did once it requires premium and same with skips. I’m not trying to complain about all of this it’s just that with out it there’s a lot of things you can’t do. One last con is that the home screen could be a little more organized. Other than those cons it’s a great app. That’s all I have to say about this. But if some of these things can happen or the app can improve I would definitely give it a better rating.",kawaichan_58
Spotify,2021-09-27 18:01:30,Liked song issue,4,"I absolutely love this app, but as of recently (since the beginning of September, I believe) when I put on a song and mark it as a liked song, the next song that will play will show it as a liked song, even if it isn’t a song I know or have liked. It’s the same way for unliked songs, too. If it’s a song I don’t know or don’t have liked, it doesn’t show up in the liked songs playlist, but it’s quite annoying and extremely confusing because the only way I can tell if I have already liked it is by searching through the playlist or having to press the like button and see if the song was added or removed from the Liked playlist. I know it’s just a minor glitch but as I said, it’s gotten quite annoying as of recently. I’ve even tried restarting my phone and checking for any updates, which didn’t work. But the app is still amazing and works perfectly fine, I just wanted to report this so it could get fixed or if I could just get info on what to do to fix it.",🎃Az🎃
Spotify,2022-06-16 16:44:51,Slight glitches,4,"Okay so the first one has to do with the lyrics. So you know how if you scroll below the song you’re listening to, you’ll find the lyrics? For me, there’s a blue outline around the lyric box-thing. It’s not a performance-affecting glitch, it just kind of annoys me a little. Another glitch for me is where if I’m listening to a playlist on shuffle, and the playlist ends, it won’t send me back to the first song, it just begins to play songs from the ‘liked’ playlist. I don’t know if this is intentional or if it’s just a glitch, but either way, you don’t have to fix it right away, it’s not a major glitch. The final glitch (one that I think has to do with my headphones but I’ll put it here just in case) is where if I try to shuffle a playlist (made by me), while my Bluetooth headphones are connected, I won’t hear any music, and then my headphones disconnect spontaneously. Like I said, I think it has something to do with my headphones, but I’ll put that glitch here anyway just in case if it’s an app glitch. Thanks for reading! Have a great day!",PastelFox🦊
Spotify,2020-11-30 20:14:36,"Love this, has all my faves but…",3,"Ok first of I absolutely love this app, it as all my favorites for free, but I have a few  reasons why I gave it three stars. if you have the free plan I think u should be able to have unlimited skips premium or not. Also I think you should add lyrics to the songs and also a thumbs down or dislike button. And you also should be able to delete your recently played songs and albums from view. But overall it’s a great app and it’s nice how you guys at least let us have a 14 day free trial with how it would be like with premium but I think you guys should make it 30 or 20 days. Thanks again for making this app and P͟L͟E͟A͟S͟E͟ read my suggestions.

UPDATE: ok so my 14 day free trial just ended :( and to be honest the app isn’t as good without the premium version, there’s ads like after every song and you can’t pick that one song you wanna hear except u got to wait and listen to all the ads and other songs until u get to that song, and you only have 6 skips, I really think you guys should AT LEAST let us pick that one song we wanna hear, by letting us pick which song to start with instead of a random shuffle.",an asphalt 8 fan
Spotify,2020-10-13 02:50:11,All good overall,4,"I had pretty biased thoughts originally with this app. I knew that it was a good app, just through the ratings. I got this app a while ago. I didn’t like the fact that everything was played on shuffle with other songs. But then again you have access to millions of songs. There has to be some benefit to the people who put this together. I listened to Apple Music for a while. No ads, but each song costed a dollar or so. My neighbors agreed that I should use this app. They made it seem like all that. I didn’t really believe them to be honest. When the second season of football started for me, I knew I wouldn’t be able to conjure up the mentality for this by myself. I tried it out, it was pretty good actually. I kept making playlists. This app is organized. One skip every ten minutes, ore six skips every hour.  Now I have my earbuds in whenever I can. One thing that would be cool is the time the song was made or published. Overall, this app works great for me, and if you haven’t tried it yet, I totally recommend it.",Sam B1026
Spotify,2019-07-12 09:04:58,Love it but miss it,3,"The new update is nice. But I really miss the old version. ESPECIALLY having the alphabet on the side. It helped me whenever I was at a red light and can find a song within 5 seconds. That being said, I have only ever been the ‘Driver Mode’ once. And that was by pure luck. When I looked for it again, I didn’t know how to get back to it. It would be beneficial to have that option more easily accessible. 
Another feature I miss is having the ‘Recently played’ this was at the bottom half of the ‘Your Library’ screen. 
Fourth. I’m confused by the Artist Screen. I like that I’m being suggested new artist and have my top ‘listened to’ on the upper half. However, I would like the option to maybe view all of my artist, in alphabetical order or narrow the list of my top listened to. 
Finally. I am Latina. However, when I recently went on the main ‘Latin’ playlist. I was surprised to find only 11 playlists within. At first I thought my app wasn’t fully loaded. After reopening it, I come to find that that was it. Before, there were countless genre playlists and artist playlists within the Latin mood. What happened to the rest???????",light.room.

So the love part is that I love to listen to music in the car, it’s amazing so I can download the playlists I like and I am VERY obsessed with music, I have over 15 hours of songs together in my regular daily basis playlist. I love to listen to music all the time, like when I’m doin chores, when I’m the car, just relaxing, and when I’m doing homework. And I love to listen to podcasts when I am on the go or before I go to bed. Ok so let’s get to the ridiculous part, whenever I would download a slowed version of a song except as a podcast it would stay in my “downloaded” section of podcasts and I would listen to them fine but a few days later it would be gone!! It wasn’t in my library anymore so I thought that I could search it back up but IT WASn’t there!! It said ERROR every time I would do the picture thing to search a song up☹️😤BUTTTTTT whenever I would go offline when I’m in the car and there is no wifi around THEY COME BACK TO MY DOWLOAD LIBRARY but here is the thing since they never finish downloading again so basically it’s like they are not there....this gets sooooooo annoying..

Spotify,2019-04-08 16:25:33,Inconvenient,2,"Great music player and I would definitely recommend it, if they didn’t make so difficult to play a single song. If you want to play just one song, chances are, it will play a totally different song that you didn’t want to hear. It has a feature called “extra songs” that add recommended songs to you, which wouldn’t be a problem if they didn’t play those songs BEFORE the song you wanted to listen to in the first place. They also add extra songs to your playlists. There is no work around this issue. You can stop all the extra songs one at a time from playing, but it takes forever and if it’s a song from one of your other playlists it’ll delete the song from that playlist as well. You can skip the song, but you only have six skips a day unless you get the premium version, which wouldn’t be a problem except for the fact that you can’t get the premium on the app. Which eliminates the entire point of this app...convenience. This problem would be SO easy to fix, but they deliberately try to make the app inconvenient so you’ll buy the premium version that you can’t get on the app!

Starting off, I was told by a really respected coach in my area that I only had one great player. He told me work her to death and forget about the rest. I really thought about that moment long and hard. The more I thought about it the more it irritated me. Yes I took a team that no one drafted because it was daughters first year and she didn’t make it on the “real” other teams. It was a rough year with one win but the girls all pulled it together as a team. Now looking back, I never put them down for a mistake but only pushed them harder. When they were down I would do whatever I could to lift them up. The next year I had my most regrets. I picked my own team and we dominated, but like you said I was in it to win it. A couple girls didn’t come back after that year because I left them in the outfield and never gave them a chance. I will definitely keep on listening, thanks for the great words.",coach TR
Spotify,2022-07-26 23:35:25,This needs to be gone PLEASE,3,"The app is good honestly but the ads and the fact that you cant even listen to a specific playlist without there being different songs in it that aren’t supposed to be in the playlist is really aggravating. Like i get it! We dont have premium and the only way we can get our music played with unlimited skips and no ads is with premium but it’s so upsetting that we have to have other songs put into a playlist with only ONE specific artist in it! For example, i was listening to a Chase Atlantic playlist and theres so many other songs in it that have been made by other artists. I wasted all my skips on trying to get back to the Chase Atlantic songs. It makes me mad. I know i can just get premium but every time i buy it, my monthly bills for everything else i pay for goes up. I get that thats my fault and my personal problem but i honestly cant buy premium anymore. It makes me go broke. Anyways, yeah it was going to be 4 stars but never mind. I change it to three for SO MANY ads and the uninvited songs. Other than that the app is okay i guess.",lolfunneh
Spotify,2021-07-22 06:02:57,PLEASE Give Us A “Downloaded Songs” Option,5,"Absolutely love this app, and think it’s just about perfect, but would LOVE a feature on the app to shuffle everything that’s downloaded to the device. I’m aware of “offline mode” and that you can clicked the “liked songs” playlist in that mode, but there a bunch of songs I haven’t liked or hearted that I have downloaded on my phone — full albums, stuff from radios and playlists, etc. I’m hoping for an option to view everything I have downloaded, not just what I have liked, and shuffle all of it — or in a perfect world, build radios/playlists from that. 

I feel like what I’m describing is only a half a step away from features already existing on the app and this would make my next road trip a lot smoother with less to think about as I’m driving through dead zones with no service and have no idea what I want to listen to.

Spotify,2018-05-27 18:43:07,Going to lose a loyal customer,4,"So when I first found this app (when it first came out) I thought it was the best in the world 😍. It had features that no other music app did, primarily the ability to listen to your music while offline. I have given rave reviews to numerous friends over the years. I have 2 accounts, 1 free and 1 premium. I hadn’t used my free one in a while and needed to change some settings on a couple playlists. When I signed into my other account, the layout was completely different!! I cannot see the songs in my playlist (as I could previously), I can’t make any changes to my playlists. IT MAKES NO SENSE TO HAVE A PLAYLIST THAT YOU CANNOT EDIT. Please fix this, the layout is not user friendly, it’s cheesy looking and critical settings I was previously able to change are no longer available. I will be in the process of cancelling my premium account as well as telling my other friends with premium accounts about a better app. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because I can still actually stream music (as do many other FREE music services).",Ladybug483

When I click the “and more” to try and edit, it doesn’t do anything. I deleted the app and reinstalled it, hoping it would fix my problem, but it didn’t. I tried seeing if it needed to be updated, but it doesn’t. I don’t know if it’s a user thing or a programming issue. If it was fixed, I would very happily rate this 5 stars, because it is an amazing app. It’s been fixed since then, but every time I open my app now, the playlist I was playing last time glitches, pausing and unpausing quickly, like somebody was holding down the space bar. I have to change the playlist, and that doesn’t always fix the problem. Plz fix this?!!!

(Edit): there’s a new glitch on mine, idk what’s happening. I’ll click play on this one playlist I made, and it’ll play one song before stopping, kinda like I deleted and redownloaded the app. Plz fix this idk what’s happening, and I really like this playlist of mine.",Lila loves unicorns

1) I saw it mentioned in other reviews that this feature previously existed, but was taken out for some reason. the ability to listen to only the music i have liked from an artist rather than the artists whole discography on shuffle would be really, really nice to have!!
2) this is a little picky but it’s really affected my experience with the app in comparison to other platforms: being able to view previously played songs in the queue. including songs you’ve added to the queue yourself! if I go back to a song that I added to the queue it takes me to the song in the playlist I was listening to; the one before the song i added. there’s no way to get back to a song i’ve added in the queue after it’s finished playing.",MannabelleA

My brother has the newer versions, and I noticed on his the UI has gone to hell. My main gripe is with the removal of the scroll bar, and from what other reviews I see here, the saved artists pages has gone backwards in quality. I know that apple’s push for Apple Music puts y’all in a difficult situation, but if they have a scroll bar why can’t you. I’ve been trying to police myself from updating it and I’ve had to cancel a few close call updates to prevent the features I like from disappearing. Please add them back instead of every update being “big fixes”. If whatever little glitches are “bugs”, then the removal and downgrade in UI is a roach-wasp hybrid that needs to be squashed. Please.

Although I’m not one to complain about ADs, I just hate how…strange they are. Well let me explain as best as I can. 
I usually get around three-four ADs, and when these ADs end, usually three songs play. However, sometimes I get the struggle of only getting one song to play then two or three advertisements play. It’s utterly annoying. Especially since it starts off with the same AD. Then don’t get me started about the struggle with the 30-minutes of free interrupted listening. I enjoy it, honestly, but sometimes when I comply with the add, it lies to me. It still gives me ADs even when I press and listen to that while AD; it gives me more!! I get super frustrated.

Only on two of my playlists, when organized by ARTIST, they don’t play in song order. They bounce all over the place in that same artist. Very frustrating. They had me make a whole new playlist and move all 300 songs over and I had the same issue. It seems to only be on 2 of my playlists that I’ve noticed. They insulted me by asking if I was sure shuffle wasn’t on. 
I’ve been a premium user for a long time now, I know how to use the app, and I’ve never seen this problem. No one has a solution for me. They tried to tell me that something is happening on their end, but they still haven’t resolved it.

It’s happening to so many people and is the most obnoxious thing. The only way to prevent this from happening is to actually have the app opened and using it.

I have to wait until the song actually plays to add it to an already existing playlist. If I want to add an entire album to a playlist I can’t anymore. And now I can’t even play albums because whenever I click on them none of the songs or a play button appears. Idk what’s going on with this app but you guys need to change it back.

Spotify,2019-03-27 00:46:24,Look,3,"It’s hard to find songs I had recalled and recommend songs are sort of bad. Now, I’m not sure if the computer’s choice of song as a recommendation are blatantly narrow, due to typical music quality or beat, but it get the atmosphere, tone, and rhythm of recommended song don’t satisfy. I’m selfish, sure, but SoundCloud does that for me; flowing with my vibe. I have some suggestions, and they go as listed:
1. I know Shazam already exists, but with this company’s massive art library, I think it’ll probably work better, but adding something that can detect songs sung or play would definitely help.
2. Able to listen to a 15 second snippet of a song, why not hear and judge the song if someone would like it. It’s hell when you have to take a risk of opening a song, only to get an ad and then later get another. If it’s too much work going through all music, you could notify a small survey asking listeners which section a song they enjoy the most.
3. Better recommended song instead of playlists of the same artist, cuz this is also another reason why ghost artist are masked by repetitive artist recommendations -w-",Takfhsjb
Spotify,2022-09-02 23:03:25,There are better music apps if you want better sound quality.,5,"How much does it cost a fool to get us better sound quality? That’s kinda gay. I understand a little... but honestly as a selling point, better sound quality on top of already- pretty decent quality is not much of an offer. Like if you’re going to try to include irrefutable offers, then the sound quality has gotta be amazing if it’s gonna be listed.

 So really, if I’m listening to music for the sound quality, it won’t make a lot of sense for me unless I hear a huge difference. And there are loads of people who pay for all of the other things on this app, to make that element not as nice for people who don’t pay for premium isn’t detrimental, but it isn’t beneficial for either party to have this the way that it is. 

Face it, that selling point isn’t enough for a majority of your customer base on account of the quality of your sound quality is enough for most cheap people like myself. The only way I could imagine you make a profit off of that >offer< is if they have a really crappy phone and it’s the only way to enjoy music.

I’d say don’t hold out on us. Because it won’t change most of our minds and will get your app a better rating if making this alleged “better sound quality” free. It really cracks down to if it is even a basis to compete with other producers of this similar product. 

Anyways thanks for reading this

Spotify,2020-06-12 22:21:09,Hard to listen to the song you want,1,So I decided to get the app and use the free version and it worked fine on my computer but than I tried it on my phone and it was bad. First I wanted to listen to music so I listened to my library with an album and I kept skipping until my song but for some stupid reason it only lets you skip music 6 times unless you get a member ship (continue reading to know why I think they did this willingly) and it also didn’t let you choose any specific song. So I than got to my song after a song I really didn’t like and than after that song I finally got to listen to the song I wanted and after that it played a song not even from the album and I wasn’t able to skip it because I used up all my 6 skips (that’s why I think they made to skip over 6 songs using a membership (because they make you have to skip those kind of songs through a paywall)) so I realized it was on shuffle so I searched up how to turn it off because I couldn’t find it and when I searched it up it told me to click a certain button but it wasn’t there so I deleted the app. Thanks for reading this and hopefully updating (the app at least) and I can bump up the score too at least a 4.,J.splat
Spotify,2018-05-03 23:02:48,Timing out?,1,"This app was great up until a few updates ago. I’ve held off on posting because I was hoping that te next update or the next would fix the problem I’m having. Almost every time I pause my music for more than a couple minutes, it’s like the app refreshes itself. I can hit the play/pause button all day and it won’t do anything. I have to physically go into the app and restart the music. It’s becoming very frustrating to have to go into the app almost every time I pause my music.

Update: the timing out problem has been worse and worse!!! More often than not, when I pause, I have to go back into the app to let it reload. Something else it’s started doing within the last few updates, is sometimes, after it times out a couple times, it will show the time on a song counting up, but the song will not be playing. When I pause it, it jumps back to 0:03, and jumps forward to wherever it was when I hit play again, still with no sound. The only way to fix that is by completely closing out of the app and reopening it. At this point, the only reason I’m still paying $9.99 a month for this is because I don’t have reliable WiFi when I’m not home, and I like to listen while I’m out and about.",Fallenzero1
Spotify,2022-09-04 11:45:38,Good music source but a few issues for me,3,"I would’ve rated this a 5 star, but I have a some issues, one being I can’t sort my music playlist? I know how to but it just doesn’t show the “[search] [sort]” options for me when I scroll up, it can be annoying since I need to change the song orders at least a few times or else it’ll just annoy me and I’ll get bored of the playlist. The music will randomly stop sometimes, and it doesn’t have anything to do with my headphones or anything, it’ll just stop and then I’ll have to restart the app, it’s really annoying

I cant hear any songs when I try to add songs from the [add songs] > [ search] I have to get out of the playlist search for the song and add it, it can be really annoying.

If I add a certain song first in a playlist the suggestioned songs will stay the same no matter how many times I add a different song, it’s so annoying since I really like to add different songs, but I cant find any playlist that I like or go with the certain playlist, and I normally add songs at least every 2 days.",5 stars really good!
Spotify,2021-01-15 03:51:30,Horrendous,5,"At first, it’s all cool. The upside is that you can play the music you want. However you can’t listen to a song itself, you have to add that song to a playlist. And you can’t listen to the playlist in order, it’s always in shuffle. There’s also a ridiculous number of ads. You can get rid of these things by paying a monthly payment (which I don’t have the money for). However, that is not what made me write this review. 

Every time, I open the app and start playing a song after a period of thirty minutes to an hour, the app closes and the song stops playing. So I restart the app and the song. However it does this several times in a row. I have done everything to deleting the app and reinstalling it, to making sure enough stuff is deleted off my storage space. I have also searched the internet looking for a solution and found none. At first I just dealt with it, but after so long it becomes really frustrating. And with that plus all the ads, it just isn’t worth the hassle. 

The final straw was today when I kept getting suggested tracks on a playlist that already had over an hour worth of songs. Normally, since this isn’t happening to other people, I would just assume it has something to do with my phone. But it only happens with this app and only this app. 

And if you try to give them a complaint or ask for customer service, it’s like hurting cats. It’s absolutely not worth it.",Caleb-bone
Spotify,2020-10-08 05:29:11,I love it sm buuuutttttt,5,"the app is utterly amazing but i would love some equality to pc and mobile, playlist personalization is #1 for me, adding pics and bios should be on mobile and also i think there could be a more accurate “recommended” tab on playlists, mine usually goes by artists instead of genre or style. one other thing is that when you start a new playlist and it says add songs and it pulls up the pop-up for searching it closes every time you add a song but instead you could just keep it open and add many songs at once instead of having to reopen it or go individually by each song to add. I think the same thing goes for adding songs to playlist where you could have a select future he could select many many songs instead of pressing add to playlist each time individually just to add playlist making efficiency. don’t get me wrong this app is my favorite one in my entire phone I use it probably too much:)",WARHAMR50
Spotify,2020-05-06 23:10:52,Crashes as soon as I open the app,4,"Tonight I was going on my iPad and see if I could somehow click a link to a song that’s not out where I live yet and then my app crashed as soon as I opened it. I first thought it was only because I did that. I restarted my iPad and then went back in, it still did the same thing. After trying that I decided to try and go on my other iPad and then trying to go in because I thought it must just be on the 1st iPad where it first crashed, and when I tried to go into the app on my iPad that it didn’t start on, it still crashed. I went searching for answers and then found one that said to delete the app, restart the device, and then reinstall the app, I tried that thinking that it had to work because it would sign me out and if it was only on that account, it would fix it. I tried that, but then when I tried it, it still crashed. This just started tonight. I know that you guys just put out an update yesterday, but please put out another small update just fixing that bug. Thanks!",kittens are sooooo cute
Spotify,2023-04-13 05:55:52,Let users have a custom playlist order,3,I love this app. Ive been a premium user for years now because I love being able to play music whenever and wherever I want to. But I cannot fathom why you keep taking away the custom playlist option. I do not want to see my most recent playlists or playlists in alphabetical order. I want to see them in the order I put them. It was bad enough on the phone app. But putting on the desk top is so stupid. I can’t even change the order playlists appear on my profile now because you changed the library on desktop. I’m so frustrated and I hate having to scroll to find my playlists. I want them to be where I put them. It makes me not want to use the app because the extra amount of time it takes to find the playlist that I created and put in a specific order is gone because you think I automatically want to see my most recently listened to stuff. Just give me an option to have a CUSTOM order for the library. I’m paying premium. So why don’t you treat it as such? It takes away user expression.,Skozephrenic
Spotify,2022-08-12 01:03:17,Love the app just some issues,4,"I‘m not gonna hate on the app too much cause there’s not a lot to hate tbh. However, I have a few issues with the app. One, the app choices certain songs to play instead of actually randomizing it. They play a few select songs and it’s wearing out the music I actually like. Two, you can only randomize it. Sometimes there’s one song that I want to continuously listen to because I like that song. Three, that I have to pay the premium to choose a specific song. I mean I get the ads cause you’re getting money out of it but to make me pay a monthly subscription just to listen to a specific song. It’s annoying. Four, I have to turn off suggested music. If I add these certain songs in my LIKED PLAYLIST, that means I want to listen to MY LIKED SONGS. Not random songs and then that’s all it’ll play and I end up wasting my skips cause of that. It’s highly annoying. Just don’t add suggested songs and have that the only thing that’s playing after a couple of good songs.",BethK.Nikki
Spotify,2021-12-23 19:10:41,To Many adds,3,"Hey, I know no one would read this and try to fix it but I’m typing because there may be a chance. I love this app and I used to use it all the time and at one point I got premium on my old phone. I also loved the add and then you get 30 min of no adds which was genius and made me feel like the app really cared about me. I used to ride in the car on road trips and turn on my music, listen to one add and then fall asleep while songs played in the background. But now it is 2 to 3 ads after every 2 SONGS, I cant fall asleep while listening to ads every 8 to 10 minutes. This makes me not want to pay for premium because I don’t feel like it deserves my money because it doesn’t care about me, I also feel like it’s a huge scam anarchy because it’s like “you have to pay for premium because we will spam you with ads” I love the app and it would be a 5 star if there weren’t as much ads. I know that you guys need money but I feel like it’s over kill. I know other people feel the same as well. If you did read this I thank you for your time.",Does the nickname even matter
Spotify,2019-08-19 23:16:23,ADS,5,"Four ads every 15 minutes is ridiculous. You are pushing premium on all of your users and I don’t understand how half of them tolerate it. And on top of that you don’t change the ads for a year or even longer. So every 15 minutes its the same EXACT ad that I just listened to before it. And throw 3 more of the SAME EXACT ADS as last time on top? And we can’t even pick the songs we get to listen to?! We can only skip the current song and hope for the best. And i find that extremely unfair after you for 1. Push premium on all of your unsubscribed members. And 2. Give us 4 ads at a time. 3. RARELY change the ads up so it isn’t so repetitive. 4. Deny us the ability to choose what we want to listen to. And 5. You DO NOT give us 30 minutes of “ad-free music”, 3 songs play each about 4-5 minutes long and then ad after ad after ad after freaking ad bombard us. Would have given 1 star but there aren’t any problems with the actual music streaming normally.",Monkey_Biy:p
Spotify,2023-03-21 14:59:25,Needs UI improvement.,5,"Good platform that has most content and features you’d expect from a top provider in the  industry. There are a lot of minor issues that have existed for years though and I’m only saying 5 so it will be seen. 

Navigating through podcast episodes to get to the one that you are currently listening to (say so you can queue up an upcoming episode.) Currently the options are to start navigating from either the oldest or newest episode, that’s it. Next, the shuffle is far from being a true shuffle. Often the same handful of songs will be playing in a somewhat random order, but tons of songs will be played repeatedly while others I forget I’ve even downloaded. Honestly I could go on but I’ll stop here. 

That being said I use it everyday and love it. I just wish that the focus of updates would shift away from predicting what users want to hear and fix these nearly 10 year old problems.",ddgydkkc
Spotify,2019-06-03 14:48:14,Reasons you shouldn't get this app,5,"Yes it is a very good app it has most of the songs you want and you can make your own custom playlist. These are very good except for the downsides, they outweigh the good spy a lot in this case. 
    There are so many ads every five minutes and the only way you can get them to go away is if you have a membership which yes is a good cost but you shouldn't have to pay for no ads for a membership which also you can play anywhere without Wi-Fi. 
    One thing that's driving me crazy now, it's a big no-no! I've had this app for about a year now, and it brought up a picture. Where you are there to sign in or get a account. I can't use it there's no way to get off of the picture it showed me the only way you can get off of it is if you sign it or get a account. And I really kind of makes me mad especially when it says you can get the app for free and not have to pay anything unless you want to. 

     This was a good app while lasted.",Goodball164
Spotify,2021-12-06 17:54:35,Doesn’t work,1,"The constantly changing playlists are still extremely annoying and disrupt the experience if you use downloaded versions (which I always do since I found them streaming and eating my data even on WiFi in the past)

There’s still ads in podcasts even if you pay, sometimes even 3 MINUTES LONG. I understand this is because the creators are paid so little that they need further revenue. Maybe pay them more so they can stop putting garbage up that I paid not to listen to

There’s no option to hide certain artists or podcasters which is very annoying because even though I’ve told the app I don’t like a song and want it to be skipped, but it still plays other music by the artist. I still can’t get it to stop putting Mumford and sons in playlists and their music makes me nauseous. Furthermore I keep getting suggested podcasts by an alt right transphobe who’s name I’d rather not even read, and there’s no way to hide his page or the suggestions. I would also like to hide the Christian music section, unless they will also add a Jewish music section that Christians can’t hide - just another example of Christian ideology being forced onto the world",andywarcats
Spotify,2020-01-01 07:17:15,"Stupid playlist problem, otherwise great.",3,"The problem for me is in the playlists! If you add music to your liked songs or playlists, the app will add it’s suggestions in as well. If it’s in the liked songs it’s fine because it will go away once you add about 15+ songs, but in your playlists it’s always there. This would be fine if they just displayed related songs, but not played them. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, in your playlist it will say “you added:” and the songs you actually want to listen to, and then “we added:” and songs that will play if you want them to or not. I don’t know if you can get rid of it by getting premium, but I don’t want to pay for it either way. I absolutely do not want to pay every month just to not listen to songs I DIDN'T ADD in the first place!!! Otherwise the app is fine, it has free music with just a few ads, and a lot of songs not available on other apps.

Please change this feature, I’m sure many others will be disappointed to find out they will waste battery listening to songs they didn’t even want to add.",",,,,,,,//////"
Spotify,2018-04-22 15:40:06,ideas,5,I love this app so much. i use it everyday almost constantly. it always works for me and has all the music i want. when i’m using it though i always think of two things i wish it had. 1) be able to combine playlists together so i don’t have to switch over to a different one while i’m driving. there’s the “add to” option for songs but if you could hold down the playlist and it said “add to” and then you could select playlist you want to add the other to that would actually be the best feature ever. 2) i wish you could change the order of songs singularly in a playlist. with premium i know you can choose whichever song you want to hear next but when i’m sleeping or driving i don’t want to have to manually change it or have it in shuffle. there’s been times i wish i could drag the songs around because i want songs to be heard in a certain order so being able to drag it around while editing the playlist would be awesome!,Ynattirb rekceb
Spotify,2019-05-10 14:36:26,Podcast issues,3,"I use to love the app for the podcasts. I don’t know if the issues since the first of the year are built in to push premier not.  I am a big Stuff You Missed in History Class fan. I have been catching up on it and used to be I could sort it by un head and older podcasts and got through it in order that way. Then it started playing the previous podcast I just heard, so driving I had to either listen or cut app off. Driving and operating an app is dangerous so I disconnect via steering wheel. Then it stopped showing podcasts as being played. Now it does not sort and have to scroll through all podcasts to find last one. Well when that is done it goes back to the previous listened podcast. 
So long story short I cannot listen in car or at work. I will find another way of listening to all different podcasts. There are some nice ones out there. I would pay for premium if the downgrades are fixed but no notice was given. 
I gave a 3 star rating as there is nothing wrong with the music portion. I can hear my faves including foreign groups like Lordi. If fixed will update.",Lvira

It has learn more link that will take you to more web page with plan details but  nothing there to direct me to subscribe the premium plan either in the app or the webpage it opened up. I really curious whether I am with low IQ or it has poor design considerations. I played with app for almost 1 hr and could not figure out how to subscribe to premium plan. I went to app sportify app’s setting >>accounts>> premium. There it shows offer and learn more hyper link. When I clicked that learn more link web page opens with details but nothing about how to subscribe 😕. I am curious after 1 hr treasure hunt I still not figure out how I can buy premium. I would how many people like me who want to buy/ subscribe premium plan though Sportify app but could not find it. I am curious lost revenue to the sportily.

Spotify,2021-11-06 13:36:48,Driving mode anti-safety,4,"Great app. Driving mode can be a real hassle though. Something that was designed to make it safer while your driving actually changes your entire screen and limits your options, which encourages you to take more time and effort to remove driving mode just to search songs. Otherwise you’re doomed to continually hit skip songs forever until you find one generally in the field of what you’re in the mood for or why you were hoping for. Which kind of defeats the purpose of why I pay for the app in the first place. I constantly find myself removing driving mode. It also changes the screen options from what I’m familiar with, to another screen I have to visually browse to utilize. Meanwhile, it removes functions I’m accustomed to having. Driving mode is inconvenient, unconventional and more of a hassle than what it’s worth. It’s a little ridiculous to assume what your customers need for their own safety while potentially creating more problems for them.",Jonnytaino

How can 6 lists all be the same from month to month ? I have unliked every song I ever hit ""like"" on.  Removed every artist and album in case it was going off that.

One of, if not the best music app I’ve ever had the pleasure of using. I’ve had no ads.

Now, I have a singular issue. When I’m making a playlist and I accidentally add one and I want to rearrange it, I’m better off just making a new playlist entirely. You can’t take a song and move it down, or up the list to my knowledge. Leaving me having to remove the song entirely and then add it back later, which is annoying, time consuming, and just overall a pain. I don’t feel it’d be hard to fix.

Now because of this crappy design not only is thumb tapping uncomfortable because you have to reach to the center of the screen instead of just the edge, you straight up can’t thumb tap songs on tablet. I also really miss how easy it was to open the search tab and library when they were just at the bottom of the screen. The service itself is very good, never had issues with streaming quality, downloading songs is awesome, and some of the mixes it suggests are pretty decent given you have listened to enough music for them to determine what you like. UI on mobile should promote a comfortable ui to use from an easy resting position before visual looks, which are more of a desktop luxury.",Gloryhound20

I can’t find all of the songs that I have saved in my library. Not too big of an issues but sometimes I want to listen to everything since I have a wide range of music that I listen to. This layout doesn’t give me the option to do that. Another problem is when I’m listening to specific artist. The old layout had the option of listening only to the songs that you have saved by a certain artist but this does not for some reason. I was listening to Flyleaf and although all the songs I had saved by them were playing so were songs that I never heard of by them. I am not in a mode where I want to find new things by them right now.

I have been introduced to many of my favorite artist through your services and I can’t thank you enough.  I do have a MAJOR complaint though.  When I chauffeur my friends around I usually hand them my phone and let them play their music since I have premium.  That’s fine for the night but I don’t have the same taste in music as they do.  So as a result my daily mixes have their music shuffled into my own or are completely their music. There is no way to down vote their music or tell the app that I don’t like this kind of music so it is constantly added to my mixes.  Have of my daily mixes have been unlistenable for months now.  PLEASE DO SOMETHING to fix this... a thumbs down button that would not be a down vote to the creator but a ‘this is not for this user’ button.  Just so the app knows what I like. And an upvote for music I do like that isn’t added to the likes playlist.  Thank you for coming to my TED talk. Keep it up.,Theguyfromthehouse

I hate that now in your recently played, if you tap a recently played artist, it takes you to their page and not your songs you have saved. It’s super inconvenient and stupid. Also I don’t like that you’ve never been able to see who follows your playlists, or when someone follows you. Also It would be great if the app actually informed you on recent activity with all the artists you follow, and not just random ones on unprecedented occasions. It would be super awesome too if when you shuffle or just out on one of your longer  playlists, it actually plays through All THE SONGS, not just like a fraction of them expecting you to be content by then. Just because a playlist may be over 10 hours doesn’t mean I don’t want to hear all of them, it means I made a ten hour playlist with songs I WANT TO HEAR 💀 Anyway, that’s been my recent beef with the app I think is superior anyway",Señor Siete

I either have to listen to one, change shows then listen to next one, or I have to add it to the “episodes” playlist.  Episodes is great.  It plays them in order.  However it plays them in the reverse order that I select them in.  Ok well that’s close.  I just select them in reverse order and it plays on the order that I want.  Except when you miss a day or 2 and want to catch up on older podcasts first... it becomes way too much of a hassle for me to try and get the order right. Then if I mess up I have to remove it from episodes and add it back in again.  It’s just a hassle.  There should be a simple way to edit the order of the playlist and there just isn’t.  It would be a huge quality of life upgrade for me.  Thanks.",Clahck
Spotify,2021-05-28 21:10:40,it’s good but not so much,3,"Ok so here’s my positives, I like the variety of music, you can have a playlist of your favorite songs, and I can do something else while playing it now here’s what’s wrong with it IMO (in my opinion) first when your listening to liked playlist or any other it might play music you don’t like or want like if your listening to your favorite’s it might give you a random not EVEN FAVORITED SO WHY IS IT THERE, also you can skip it but you only get 6. Every. Hour. Which is the most BRUH MOMENT EVER to skip songs you INTENTIONALLY GAVE ME THAT I DONT WANT TO NOT LISTEN TO THEM I HAVE TO USE SKIPS WHICH I ONLY HAVE 3 OF and to get more skips guess what? YOU NEED PREMIUM LIKE NOBODY WANTS PREMIUM LIKE WHAT WHY IS THAT A THING BRO so yea I can’t even listen to the music I WANT TO THAT I FAVORITED FOR A REASON and MOST OF THE MUSIC ISNT MY TYPE, I HATE IT, OR I WANNA DIE BECAUSE I HAVE TO LISTEN TO IT. so yea that’s my problem with it but I’ll be generous because today is a good day and I rate this app 3/5 (because being able to play songs and exit out of the app and do something else is REALLY USEFUL and the only good/best part of this whole app)",just your daily person
Spotify,2021-08-05 13:25:25,Awesome! - but hoping for some updates…,5,"The overall app is great. The playlist selection and many features of the app keep me here instead of Apple Music. I just wish there were a couple more features that would make the app easier to use.

One such feature would be if you could add entire playlists to other playlists with a few easy clicks. I like doing this for my “discover weekly” or “release radar” on the computer in case I don’t have time that week to listen to the playlist and I want to add the music to a playlist that won’t change after the end of the week, such as my “review” playlist.

Another feature would be if you couldn’t accidentally add two of the same song to the same playlist. This happens all the time when I add the same song from two different albums and I have to go through and delete one of the songs. The app is good about not allowing you to add the same song from the same album, but if an artist released the song as a single and then as part of an album you can add both without it catching it. This issue also arises if you have liked one of the “top songs” from an artist and you liked the single instead of the album version - it won’t show you liked a “top song” on the artists page.

Other than these features, I love the app and will continue to use it! But it would be nice to see these added…",Benji all day
Spotify,2018-04-03 21:15:55,Great App!,4,"I immediately feel in love into this app when I got it! The pros of this app are that the large variety of songs and artist, which is spectacular! I also enjoy listening the fact that you can save as many songs as you'd like. The fact that you are allowed to have the free trial for premium is magnificent, but I have not tried it yet. I also like the fact that you can watch an ad to get rid of advertisements for a half an hour, so I can listen to music without interruptions.
  
     However, there are quite a few cons. First, you can't listen to a thirty second preview of new songs, which saved lots of time. Then, there's also the fact that unsaved songs of yours can randomly start playing, which is great for discovering some new songs and artist, but gets irritating when I want to listen to my songs. 

       Other than that, this app is great for playing any song while out of the app, and I'm sure I will still be a user in the future! Keep improving the app to make it better and better!",Penguindayday
Spotify,2021-06-09 04:33:52,"Great app, if you have premium",4,"I got this app for the free music, and at first it was amazing. After about a month of listening there had come to be an ad after every song, and I had to get premium, to stop the ads, which is irritating, but worth it. It worked driving through the mountains with no service with the premium, and I have loved it since.

I’ve recently had an issue however, with songs not wanting to play. I’ve tried both on and off wifi, data, and just the downloaded content but almost my entire library wont play for more than 15 seconds. I’ve also tried deleting other apps and photos from the phone (thinking it was a space issue) but have continued to have this problem. It’s only been an issue since the most recent update and it’s getting very frustrating because I’d just like to listen and it isn’t working. I’ve also tried closing out the app, restarting the phone, and a couple other things with no luck.",nicknamedperson2.0
Spotify,2019-07-07 11:55:59,Update,3,"I have over 1200 songs downloaded to my phone that I listen too a lot. All of them over multiple genres. I do have a few recommendations, with the new update it made it more difficult when scrolling through the ‘liked’ playlist. Before the update there was an easy scroll option on the right if trying to get to a particular song title fast. Please bring this option back. With having this many songs I have about 7 playlists that I have created on my phone to assort the music into genres like country, rock, R&B etc. When trying to add new stuff it would be nice if the app song-search for the “recommended” section at the bottom of any created playlist could be a little more expanded/broad within the same genre that would be nice. I use this option a lot but it seems like it will get stuck on a handful of artists that I have added to the playlist and after refreshing multiple times the same 5 or 6 artists seem to keep popping up. Other than that I have no recommendations. Great app and I love it ( but room for improvement)",Fireball858
Spotify,2022-07-22 21:03:32,Just a couple issues.,3,"Now, for one thing, you say thirty minutes of ad-free listening when in reality it’ll be around twenty minutes before I get three ads for no reason! You obviously think you can be sneaky and give people THREE ADS after twenty minutes.  My next and last problem took away two stars by itself! I’ll be calmly listening to one of my favorite playlists, it has about 21 items, and suddenly, a song that I’ve never heard that is certainly NOT on my playlist starts playing. It’s a suggested track, I remember that after fifteen items are on your playlist you aren’t supposed to have suggested tracks added. I look at the playlist to remove the song and I can’t see it, it doesn’t show up. I go to skip it, and I’m out of skips. All I request is that you don’t add more tracks to people’s playlists, and if you do at least show that they are on the playlist and maybe even not add/play them when the person is out of skips. Thank you for reading this and I hope you improve these issues.",Stella-Redac.
Spotify,2022-02-21 14:53:15,Great except podcast spot not saving,4,"The app is great and I’ve loved it for years but as I’ve gotten more into podcasts and have multiple devices now (iPhone and iPad Pro) I’m frustrated that I can’t pause a podcast on the iPad then come back later in the day and start from that same spot on my phone. It doesn’t work the other direction either (from iPhone to iPad). You’d think it’d be easy for the app to track that, but it does not work, and sometimes it just jumps to either the very beginning of the podcast OR the very end as if I finished it. Only other small complaint is that after you “force click” an AirPod Pro to restart a song or podcast after pausing, it plays for a fraction of a second then pauses again; you then have to click AGAIN to make it play. Waste of time and hurts the airpod functionality. Verified with multiple pairs of airpods, and the problem does not occur with Apple Music or my midi player app, so it is definitely a Spotify-specific problem.",Doug314159
Spotify,2020-05-07 00:02:48,Here are a few flaws and perfections! ❤️,5,"I love playing songs on this and I’m even playing a song while I’m writing this review. I love this app but after playing my playlist, I go into the app, and it kicks me out. It might just be me on this, but I had to re-download the app because of this. I think you should have this fixed because it stops people from listening to the amazing songs on this app! One of things I like about this app is that when I had to re-download this, it saved all my stuff. Playlists, accounts, etc. I also think that if you could search the lyrics and the song and it would show up would be nice. I tend to forget the names of songs and this would be a big help to me. Like Acapella for example. If I could search up used to be your lady used to your baby etc. Then it would be ten times easier. Other than that I love this app! Thank you for listening. ❤️ Stay healthy!",Thepickyone101
Spotify,2019-12-17 15:52:25,Terrible Glitches,4,"Great app overall except for the fact that you add new glitches with almost every “update”. Why not fix the many problems there are with the app when they’re so obvious and should be easy to fix? Why does it not understand when I want to move a song up or down on the queue? It just crashes when I try to do that. Also why don’t I get notifications when I’m supposed to? I should get a notification of a new album from an artist I follow as soon as the album drops, but most of the time I don’t get any notification, and if I do, it comes 3 days after the album was released and I’ve already listened to it. Also, when you pause music, for some stupid reason you have to press the play button several times in order to get your music to start playing again. These bugs are so annoying and have existed for over a year now but you refuse to make the app work properly for god knows what reason. Stop focusing so much on aesthetics and actually make the app functional please.",Mike Psych
Spotify,2018-11-26 04:35:29,One more suggestion...,4,"I am really loving the new updates… It would be nice to be able to click on the three dots on a song that's playing from your playlist and have the option to delete directly while playing that song from the playlist instead of having to go edit the playlist, find the song and then delete it.

The app crashes and also makes me restart my playlist. I wish the playlist would always hold its play point (songs already played during playlist session vs songs left to play) and resume from the streaming service. I wish I could save me play point across each session. Let’s say playlist 1 has 10 songs and playlist 2 has 20 songs. If in pause playlist 1, I want to resume playlist 2 from whatever song it was playing before instead of starting allllll over. When I leave from playing playlist 1 on my Bose at my house, I want to resume in my truck from that same play point or have the option to have playlist 2 play instead.",Phillip Colligan
Spotify,2021-02-04 20:22:35,If you love commercials this is the app for you!,1,"I have been using this app in the morning when I am getting ready for work. The amount of commercials is absolutely ridiculous. In the 30-40 minutes that I listen in the morning I am lucky to get two songs played before it’s back to 3-4 commercials. And then, to add insult to injury, about half the time when the app decides to actually play a song it doesn’t. The app shows the song is playing, but there is no sound. I have to walk over and either restart the app (which guarantees only one song playing before another 2-4 commercials) or push pause and then play which restarts the song from the beginning. I know I can pay for no commercials, but in my rural location cell coverage is spotty at best so I pay for sirius which works around here. For the price of admission for no commercials on the app I can download and pay for the individual songs I want and use a usb drive or MP3 player and not have to worry about no cell coverage! All that being said, if you are looking for an app to play virtually unlimited commercials with a few songs (when they actually work) then you have come to the right place!",JTD99
Spotify,2022-10-10 19:31:57,Love this app. Wish it weren’t so political.,4,"I have been using this app since 2015, and it has never failed me. The features they are coming out with are always something super useful (although the party feature used to work better than it does currently). I spend an average of 60,000 minutes listening to music and podcasts every year, so I put in ample time on the application. I am so happy to pay a monthly premium in order to download anything I want for road-trips where I may not have service, as well as playing any song whenever I want. 

The ONLY reason I am not giving this app 5 stars is the fact that that application has gotten political recently, especially since the Joe Rogan podcasts were added. It seems like freedom of speech and unedited conversations are not allowed anymore.? And with some artists pulling music, it is upsetting to see that this type of censorship is occurring on platforms that should simply offer a listening service.",Kistang
Spotify,2018-05-27 20:00:03,"Library Interface changed, can't find things",3,"As a free user I loved it before the recent (may 17th) update and would have given it 5 stars because everything was readily organized where I could easily find albums or music I liked and was similar to the computer app or how the iTunes library looked. more specifically I liked I could somewhat choose what I wanted to listen to at just that current moment with what I've placed in those playlists, with the shuffle and limited skips of course with the occasional random addition of music.
Now however I can't find any of that and just have a favorites section that plays everything, or I have to find the artist stuff itself on the mobile app and be forced to listen to all of that, even things I don't like which I can't thumbs down (as far as I can tell) and never have to listen to it again. I can't find anything now, and if I wanted things like this I'd just use the pandora interface where I have some control with the free features on pick choosing what I want and don't want in the list.",Nostronimo
Spotify,2022-04-02 05:51:02,Eh,4,"I wanna start with the fact that, ofc!! This app is great, optional choices for music, playlists and more, an i get the fact that “you need premium to listen to music add free” crap, but in all reasoning the amount of adds recently is extremely unnecessary and i cant even listen to ONE, NOT ONE but two songs without it playing like 3-4 ads in a row and let alone how long the ads are, there rlly isn’t a need to be playing 3 ads in a row with them each being 20 seconds long :( it interrupts the peace of the music, and the fact that they repeat over and over not even a verity of ad’s just the same ones over and over is rlly unnecessary and its been a big problem lately for me, other than that, it’s completely fine! I just feel its rlly unfair to have so many ads piled onto people who cant afford or choose not to use premium and get a low experience as the premium people, but overall great app, and great music quality and i hope to see more selections soon.",Pup!!
Spotify,2022-01-10 17:19:27,"Apart from numerous glitches/bugs, still the app that I’d pick",3,"I’d give you 5 stars if there went so many glitches. I do like the app, I use it nearly everyday, but the bugs on here make it annoying to use. 

#1 problem: The app will sometimes refresh randomly while I’m using it. My music stops and when I open the app, my playlist has stopped. It either closes the playlist completely, or pauses it, which gets frustrating.

#2 problem: I added a song to my queue once and then my app did the refresh thing, and now there’s an empty space between the song currently playing and the “Next From: [playlist name]” and it won’t go away. Now the top bar and stuff on the app are always pushed up. (I have the iPhone 13 and it goes under my camera bar) I tried everything apart from uninstalling the app. It’s not really a big problem, but it’s annoying to me.

#3 problem: Sometimes my app does this glitch with the lyrics when I go into the app after entering another app. When it goes to another song, it’ll have the lyrics from the other song still there, unmoving. It’ll have the lyrics from one song stuck in the lyrics box until I close the app out. I notice the scroll for my playlist name also stops when this happens. 

I can’t think of anything else, so that’s about it.

I give the app a 6/10, 3 stars until these glitches are fixed. Since I’m not a verified artist on Twitter and just some lowly customer, you probably won’t read this. Please fix your app.",Idk Reviewer
Spotify,2021-01-28 01:19:05,Hands Down Best Music App,5,"It didn’t take me long to decide to upgrade to the Premium Membership. Everything about this app is easy to maneuver and learn. Of course with premium, I don’t deal with ads or “no more skips left”. I love how this app learns your music preferences and created numerous playlists for you to try. As well as a “Release Radar” with the NEWEST of all genres you like. Also a “Discover Weekly” is another favorite playlist it creates with songs you may not have known existed in the genres you prefer to listen to. Create your own playlists easily and download them so when you’re not able to use mobile data or WiFi, you can still play your favorite songs. If you use Google Maps, the two apps link together so you can still play your favorite tunes on the road without going back and forth between GPS & music. I HIGHLY recommend this app. There’s tons of info I haven’t listed here so go check it out and see for yourself!",SpiritFreeHoneyBee
Spotify,2021-04-23 14:26:53,Good app bad politics,3,"They got a solid app that works excellent and rarely has any issues. It is easy to navigate, easy to store music and easy to sort music into playlists. I do recommend turning off car mode. Their “Discover weekly”recommendations usually seem based on whoever makes them the most money and seldom feels like it is based on your listening habits. The “Release Radar” also seems to pepper in artists you’d never listen to and again appears based on monetary gain. The real issue is that they are constantly pushing political agendas on their “Home” screen. I listen to music to escape stress not have it shoved in my face when I’m trying to de-stress. There is also no way to remove the political garbage from the Home Screen. Now the App itself could be a solid 5 stars but as soon as it’s used to force bad political ideologies without a way to hide it, well then I start to consider using a different platform and can no longer recommend this app. Please note that I have used this app for years before making this review.",Daten_Hund
Spotify,2020-07-05 05:30:59,Lately seems laggy,5,"Idk why the app has seemed very laggy, slow, glitchy lately...even when I just play music as normal while offline (and SUPPOSEDLY having premium). It’ll have problems with shuffling music or with offline music downloads (titles I’ve already pre-downloaded for those offline moments I pay ahead of time to have ready) ...like I’m constantly seeing things disappear/not allow playback. And, noticed the filtering artists function doesn’t work %100, it’ll still shuffle random songs when I enter in an option to only listen to 1 specific artist. 
Needs work and it is constantly causing me data charges for things that should be ready in offline mode when I download them!

As a paying user and one who LOVES music I use this to keep ALL my music in one neat place. It’s stupid how many hoops you have to jump thru to get to your downloaded songs and shuffle them now. I have downloaded new albums since the update and they have not shown on my ‘Liked Songs’ yet the albums themselves have been downloaded when I go back to double check? So how do I play them without having to go to the Albums section in my Library and then scroll down to the specific album I want? With the previous update I would download an album and the songs would automatically be ‘Liked’, at the VERY LEAST bring back that one auto setting of downloading music so that all the albums’ songs I download would be in the ‘Liked’ section where I can conveniently listen to all my downloaded songs in one place without having to go through a series of tabs just to get to the songs I clearly downloaded.",lockNessie monster

Now it won’t let me and I have to press shuffle and on occasion even spend like 10 minutes skipping through to hear the song I wanted. sometimes it will start playing songs I haven’t saved. And if I had already pressed shuffle once it wouldn’t let me do it again saying you have found a premium feature 😒even if I wanted to get premium there isn’t anything anywhere on the app that lets me get it.

You can listen to virtually any song if you have premium, but the app is cluttered, clunky, confusing and very glitchy. Every time they do an update, I hope it’s been revised, but I’ve been hoping for years and it still is just as poorly laid out. In fact, if anything it seems to get worse with updates.  The number of clicks needed to perform simple functions is ridiculous.  It takes an engineering degree to figure out how the “queue” works.  Everything just feels slapped together, as if they had 30 different people design the app separately with no collaboration. I notice that almost every 4 and 5 star review here says “great, but…”.  If every review has a “but”, it’s not a 5 star app, and probably not 4 stars either.  Take my advice and use a different service, the other interfaces have to be better.  On the bright side, the music library is huge, so that gets it 3 stars.",saleen8927
Spotify,2017-11-01 23:37:48,It used to be great,3,"I've used this app for years and up until a few weeks ago, I loved it, but now it's just frustrating. Whenever I go to listen to one of my playlists, I hear a couple of my songs that I actually put on the playlist and then all that plays are a bunch of random suggested tracks that are often not even related to the kind of music that was originally on the playlist. I can see how (because I don't have premium) playing a few suggested tracks every once in a while might be acceptable but I rarely hear the songs that I have saved or that I even want to listen to anymore. 
Another thing is that the app now often glitches out. Sometimes it won't load any of the music even when I know that the connection is good. No matter how many times I hit the shuffle button, nothing will play. It will also randomly skip songs without me hitting the skip button or even touching my phone. 
This used to be such a good music app but now there are so many glitches that it's just not very enjoyable to use anymore.",Daffin Chuck
Spotify,2022-05-08 00:24:14,Love the app,3,"I absolutely love the app, if I had written this review a week ago I wouldn’t be complaining. Here’s the thing, though. I’ve started getting ads after every other song, usually two or three. Yeah, I get it, a free app should run ads to get some money, but you have the premium subscription to get money. Here’s another thing. How come you can’t run premium on the app? That’s really annoying, and if you put it on the app, you’d for sure make more money. The ads I’m getting are really pushing getting the premium subscription, but if you can’t get it on the app, then it’s just annoying. I’m also getting lots of ads for different podcasts and songs, way too many times. When I try to use the dislike feature, and tell the app I’ve heard the ad too many times, all it does is play it more. Other than that, I adore the app, it’s my go-to for music. I love that you can make your own playlists and download podcasts. It’s a great app, there’s just a few things I would rather go away, or get fixed.",igdlncjskcj

But if you are on a mobile device you can not listen to the song you want in your playlist it automatically shuffles your songs in the playlist which is quite infuriating. You must have premium to access some things which is a monthly payment. Though this is app is much better than most other music apps in my opinion. It’s much better to download this app on your desktop instead of your mobile device because you can access things much easier and your songs don’t shuffle in your playlists. —But that decision is completely up to you :-)!

I wish they would add more of the functionality the computer version has to the app. Creating similar playlists and adding pictures, small things like that really do add to experience would mostly be quality of life things. A big negative though is that the about section on the app isn’t really a thing. I can’t even remember if there is one or not on the app but I don’t feel like checking. What I do know is that it doesn’t show what countries listen to an artist most, more pictures of the artist, more things like that.

inappropriate sometimes)Not to mention that we can’t play a certain song that fits the vibe and cannot go back to the previous song.

Spotify,2019-06-25 15:01:13,"Still good, but not as great",3,"While I can still recommend this app for the most part, the new update makes it rather frustrating to navigate. 

Songs are no longer organized to their own section, and gone is the alphabet scroll bar. I used to enjoy scrolling through and finding whatever struck my fancy, but the new update forces liked songs into a playlist which, understandably, functions as a playlist. This makes it difficult to get to the lower sections, and either forces the user to just shuffle it, know all the songs by heart, or settle for playing the upper most songs without considerable effort.

A second gripe- no longer able to search my artists or albums. Artists are only the ones followed, but if I want to play songs only by a certain artist, I’ve yet to find a way to be able to short of making another playlist. Album’s too are no longer listed, it seems to be only the ones where the user follows the artist who made the album in question.

The new podcast look is no problem, and the division of music and podcasts into two adjacent sections is a pretty good play. However, not if it forces the music section to be less user friendly and in turn force it to be less functional.

If the new and old versions could be married somehow, where music is just as navigable, that’d be great. But as it currently stands, this new update seems to have forced up a new feature and the expense of some very practical features, and it’s a bummer the app is no longer quite as user friendly.",Snowboardguy22
Spotify,2018-01-17 03:11:28,Sweet and not so cool,3,"Great for iPad and computer but horrible for iPhone. Are you kidding me?? So I can't play whatever I want on an app on my phone without paying premium?? It'd be tight if I can play whatever I want on my phone. Least let me play my playlists without discovering ""new"" songs that I don't give a crap about. If you force me to shuffle my music and play songs I don't want at least don't make the app free. It's a huge turn off to get a free app only to not really enjoy the app unless you pay premium which is a lot for a mobile app when I can with the same app play whatever I like on my iPad and computer so why can't it be the same for mobile. I recommend it for computer and iPad but for mobile I'd pass unless there is a way for me to play my music even if it's just shuffling without playing music I don't want. Why do this to us who don't want to pay for premium for mobile. I don't really care for music that's ""discovering"". I just want the music in my library. I don't even mind the ads. I'll stick to pandora for discovering new music.",Three_tree88

How many songs are in the playlist, how many followers they have and the search system. I would love to see new changes like putting your playlist in a certain order. With ocd this is very bothersome. I want to put playlist in an order that I use them and move them all around To an order I like not of how they were made. I can’t keep organized. I would also like to see ways to access the radios. When I get tired of my songs and want to find new ones I want to listen to the playlist radio. I have no idea how to get to them. I also think for organizational purposes I would love to see a select button where you can select multiple songs to add them, take away or move to a different playlist.

Spotify,2020-04-19 06:05:30,Please Read,3,"Ok, so yes this app is amazing with all of the music playlists and stuff. But this one thing is keeping me from rating this app any higher than 3 stars. I love whenever I can play my music in order, sometimes I just don’t like when it plays in shuffle mode. But the last update has changed so I cannot choose if I want it in shuffle mode or not. And before the update if I slid right it would put that song in queue. And if I slid left then it would favorite the song, but not anymore. 

This last update has really gotten on my nerves and I rarely listen to music anymore. If you would just let us choose if we’d like it in shuffle or not, I believe many people would be happy. I say that we should click ‘play’ then it should ask “How would you like your music to play?” Then underneath that it should have two buttons, one says ‘shuffle’ and the other says ‘in order’. This would make life much more happier for me.

Please consider using my idea, if you do this my rating will go up to 5 stars! Just please make me and many others happy!",Bre lysosomes
Spotify,2019-07-09 22:01:45,keep playlists in alphabetical order!!!,1,"i’m very frustrated with this update. please keep the playlists sorted the way we set them to be sorted. i chose to have my playlists sorted in alphabetical order. however, when i go to add a song to an older playlist, i have to search for so long to find the right one because my playlists are now sorted by the date that i made them. i think it’s pretty common to add a newer song to an older playlist, and i know i’m not the only one who finds alphabetical order easier. i was able to put up with this on desktop, but now that you’ve moved this re-sorting to mobile, i needed to write a review. this is the most annoying feature of the app now and i get so frustrated that I have left several bad reviews in hopes that SOMETHING will happen to return the app to its former glory without this and other exceedingly frustrating features.

there should also be a way to separate the playlists that i have made from the ones i have followed. and PLEASE let us easily access how many songs we have on each playlist. it’s a small thing, but it’s so helpful to see the number of songs next to the playlist name.",Hezlo!
Spotify,2022-11-10 17:53:06,Stops randomly,4,"This app is really good. Had a variety of different music choices and podcasts. This app also makes a playlist of songs based on what your favorite artists are and what you listen too. The app only always six skips every hour (which is normal). You can buy premium and don’t have to worry about limited skips and handpick the songs you want to listen at that moment. The main problem with this app is that it randomly stops playing music at 9-11 seconds. At first I thought I let was a connection issue but when I connected to the Wi-Fi at my home it also stops. I tried to restart the app but that didn’t work. The only way I was able to get the songs to start playing again was deleting and downloading the app back. This is extremely annoying especially when I’m working out and my music randomly stops. Even after all that, this app is still really good and I would recommend it.",abunnynamed.b.b
Spotify,2021-01-05 02:32:15,Cant stand this app,5,"You literally can’t do anything without paying. So many people have talked so highly about this app and i have been nothing but disappointed. You only get 6 skips a day which is the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard, you cant play a specific song you literally can only shuffle your playlist (which, don’t forget, you only get 6 skips so if you want to listen to a specific song, you cant.) and i got 3 full ads before i even had a chance to listen to a single song. This app is completely useless without paying, which is just gross. It is 100% obvious you only care about money and not at all about the listeners, as you take every basic function of a music app and make it so it HAS to be paid for. I just don’t understand who in their right mind would pay money for the functions of an app that any other app in the app store does for FREE.",AwesomeApp!!❤❤
Spotify,2022-09-03 06:59:33,Being non-premium,2,"In my opinion, it feels like people that are non-premium barely get any freedom in the app. Ever since my free trial ended, my playlist has been stuck on shuffle mode. I can’t choose a specific song or play anything on repeat. And when I search for a certain song, all that pops up is the album the song is from. And even then I can’t pick the song I want or skip to it, I have to listen to the album until it gets to the song I’m looking for. I’m allowed ONLY 6 skips and then I have to wait a whole HOUR to get more. Usually it takes more than 6 skips to get to the song I want. Referring back to the ‘stuck on shuffle’ issue.. when my playlist “ends” it doesn’t actually end. It starts playing random songs. I feel like once the playlist ends it shouldn’t start playing random songs, it should just stop playing songs all together until you start playing another song or restart the playlist. Using this app while not being on premium just feels very, very restricting. Way more restricting than it should be.",Chloe🎵
Spotify,2022-03-09 01:43:49,Songs will play for two seconds and then stop for no reason.,1,"I’m really annoyed, because so many songs in my playlists just play two seconds of a song and then completely stop for absolutely no reason. (NOT pause, but literally STOPS and won’t let me play the song at ALL). I have no idea why this started happening but it is not anything on my end, it seems to be a bug with playlists. The songs play just fine on my computer desktop, but on my phone, this continues to happen where I’ll play a song in a playlist and it just either won’t play at all, or two seconds of it will play and then it stops. Is anyone else having this problem?? It started happening a few months ago and I’ve been waiting for whatever bug this is to get fixed, and it hasn’t. Not every single song does it, but most of them do, and it’s not a particular artist, it’s just random. Note: If I look up that song by that artist, the song will play just fine. It’s only when I go into my playlists to play a song that this will happen. Anyone else having this experience? It’s the most irritating thing.",LaurenLorenzo3
Spotify,2021-05-03 13:08:26,Some annoying glitches,3,"Overall the app has some cool features, but there are a couple glitches that prevent a five star rating. First, if you’re connected to a Bluetooth device, you cannot remove podcasts from a playlist, nor can you remove podcast downloads from your phone. Doesn’t make sense that I should have to  disconnect from external devices to use normal functions within the app. Second, concerning podcasts, I created a playlist of one of my favorite podcasts because I want to listen to only a few select shows. Instead of auto playing the individual podcasts that I’ve added to my playlist, the app will either play ALL of the podcasts in numerical order (even ones I did not add to my playlist), or play random podcasts, including ones I’ve already listened to and are labeled “played”. What’s the point of allowing us to create playlists for podcasts if the app ignores them? Why label a podcast “played” if the app is going to just play it again anyways? Please fix.",blaakpilot

Spotify,2019-06-28 12:47:15,Please fix how saved music works,2,"Edit: the new update has made things worse, unfortunately. Songs from a saved album continue to be “liked” when you remove the album from your library. Still no way to download individual songs from an album without adding to a playlist or downloading all liked songs. Was holding out for better but this needs to be fixed please.

Previously, when I only saved select songs from an album those were the only songs that showed in my library. Now, when I go to the albums in my library every track on an album will show in my library, regardless of what songs I actually saved—even if I only saved one song from the album the whole thing is there. This really complicates my playback flow and makes it hard to download only portions of an album for offline listening. I hate this change and I’m not sure if it’s an intentional update or just a bug. This app was practically perfect before all the tinkering started a couple months ago. Please at least change this functionality back to how it was before.",middlenameray
Spotify,2021-07-03 06:54:06,how good but also bad the app is,5,"the app is amazing and great but also not because sometimes it randomly stops playing is so annoying because all i want to do is listen to music without any interruptions. i have to restart my whole phone or sometimes delete the app and reinstall it again and it starts working perfectly. But i can’t keep doing that every time is takes to much time. My second reason is only 6 skips per hour?!?!?!!! at least make that 8 or 10 skips per hour that be a little better than 6 skips. 6 skips is to little because i play albums that play all the time but some songs are annoying and bad and when i skip a bad song another bad song comes on so i skip it and eventually i waste my skips. 

The app in general is amazing but please fix some of these things it can make everyone’s experience on the app more better.",princess peachhhhhhh🤪🍑
Spotify,2020-02-12 08:14:42,"Fantastic app, one suggestion",5,"I really love this app and how it all works. I’ve made a playlist with tons of songs I like, and the shuffle play is great. Though I sometimes like to fall asleep with some music playing (I’m a white noise guy,) and since the app runs with the phone off, (which is a GREAT feature,) it would be cool if there was some sort of timer. On my iPhone, you can set a timer for how long the phone can stay on before it falls asleep if you don’t click for five minutes or so. Since the app stays running when the phone is off, I’d like some sort of system like that. Maybe you can just have a menu where you click, “play for 15 minutes before stopping” or whatever. If this isn’t possible, that’s fine, the app is still great.

Also if this ends up being added, obviously don’t make the timer mandatory, so the user can still have the “play indefinitely while the phone is off” option.",Nickname Face McGee

I tested your forces “shuffle play” mode and when I switched between stations and then switched back it was the same song and not only that but it was the same place in the song. Shuffle is a lie if you keep playing the same song in the same position every time it’s a set playlist not a shuffle play. If you really want people to spend money on your app it had to work for free in order to entice people to spend money on it, a broken app doesn’t entice paid followers. Please don’t lie to me and then try to sell me a premium service that is the same service minus you dicking me and all other potential customers over. Shuffle means something as does every other word in the English language. I would not describe myself as a paid subscriber if I had not “paid” because in English words have set meanings that society only sustainably exists because we all agree on the definitions.

Spotify,2018-12-27 21:23:04,All songs?,3,"It’s an awesome app to listen to music, but you can’t see all the songs by an artist. Only the most popular and latest release. That makes it almost impossible to find some songs. You should be able to search songs from an artist.

            I also wish there was diversity all the recommended songs are immediately rap and pop music. I myself am NOT a fan of rap or pop. I know there a lot of other types of music and people who feel how I feel about those genres, there should be a mix. Like instead of always making it Ariana Grande, XXX, Drake, e.t.c (I swear I learned pop and rap music from your recommendations.)there could be some Vance Joy, Alt-J (Δ), The Lumineers. That would be nice. Also having a page to access queue easier would be great.

Its been like this for like a few months now and everything ive tried to fix it hasnt worked. The only way im able to listen to music without the songs randomly pausing is if i search up an artist and play one of the songs it recommends to me when i search their name, then after the song that i chose from that artist ends, it plays other random music thats kind of like that song or in that genre.

Spotify,2021-10-17 21:35:52,Multiple long standing bugs,3,"I love using this app, but there are many bugs that haven't been addressed in quite some time, with new ones stacking on top of them. The most recent one is when you filter to search for a song, when you queue it by swiping to the right, instead of queueing that song, it queues the overall first song in your library, which is very frustrating. Another is when you have the bar at the bottom and you try to swipe to the left to skip to the next song, it oftentimes glitches and either doesn't skip or sometimes even reverses to a previous song. Another is when you queue a song that you're listening to, it usually picks up from where you were in the song instead of the start. I'm sure there are others as well, and I feel like these are definitely solvable issues, and I don't know why they haven't been addressed yet.

Spotify,2020-12-02 04:05:25,"Love, but...",4,"Don’t get me wrong it is a great audio platform just the only issue I have is the recently played tab. I tend to accidentally hit play on random playlists or even a podcast. If you could bring back the option to edit your recently played on the mobile app that would be highly appreciated. It would save having many unnecessary playlists, albums, etc. just filling up the tab when they are not even being listened to. Another suggestion is maybe try and remove the older recently played if you could see how long it’s been based off of some sort of algorithm. For example I haven’t listened to the oldest thing on my recently played in many months maybe even a year. So please bring back the option to edit our recently played tabs on the mobile app and/or find a way to clear the other played audios based off of what is actually being listened to often.

Spotify,2018-05-09 03:13:29,Review,5,"In my opinion, the app would be best served if I could create my own library of favourite music by simply using one simple touch, instead of offering what a computer program designates as a possibility of what I like. Music is probably one if the most important arts humans can interact with and therefore creating a computer who makes a designated library will most likely never create what the app needs to have the user fall in love with the app instantly. In other words is like you have to fight with the app searching and that feature is most likely issued once a person becomes a member. I think it should be offered for free. I wouldn’t mind paying to create a library that would find and play only the music I really care to listen to. Instead the app acts like elevator background sound and lacks passion due to the lack of personalisation of options that would speak to me.

Is much friendlier than Pandora and is ok",riquilin

But I would deeply appreciate it if they'd stop playing suggested songs. Idc if my playlists is short, maybe I want it that way. Maybe they could have a list of suggested songs we could listen to if we wanted to but not automatically play it right after the playlist is over. I just want to listen to my playlist on repeat without getting irritated 24/7. ALSO, when I look up a song, I’m not looking for the playlist it’s in, I don’t want to hear all that. Like when that happens it makes me wanna delete the app, wait a few weeks and then download it again when I’m not upset, which has happened multiple times. And when I do find just the song, I CANT EVEN PLAY IT. It’s absurd to me. I think if this was changed that it could really better the app and people would like it more.

That, or sports ad #687 where coach Manns McTestosterone (coach of team, from sport) reminds you (the rookie) that clothes get dirty (during sports day event), and if you want to be a cool and manly sports man (very cool, very manly) that you should remember to wash with heavy duty detergent for your manly sporting needs (man’s detergent).
I hate sports, and these type of ads get annoying, fast. So having a way of more directly curating ads aside from waiting until you get one that you don’t like, and selecting the reason you don’t like it from a list, pretending that it does something, would be very nice.",Rookie McSportshatie

When I’m putting songs on my queue and I go back because I missed a song or I forgot to like one, it doesn’t go back to the previous song. It goes to first song I put on queue. Then when I go to check the list of songs it removes them, so I can’t even see what songs I added. It makes me really sad, guys. It would be tight if there was a way to see all the songs you played, like a history. SC was dope cause of that. AND another thing that another comment mentioned. Is when you like an album it doesn’t out the songs of that album on the likes playlist, who have to like individually. Oh and I wish the likes was just a tab like albums is a tab and playlist are a tab. Also, SC was cool cause they had like a news feed of music that your followers posted, that would be cool too 🙃",ubb_92

Spotify,2018-03-11 04:50:00,"Could use some work, otherwise good",4,"As a music streaming app, it works great.
I can deal with ads and limited skips, or pay for premium. It isn't perfect and it has its issues but I want to specifically address this one. 
The way the playlist radio functions is absolute garbage unless you pay for premium. If you like a song, you can never undo that action and liked songs will repeatedly show up when you use the radio, thus forcing you to listen to it or waste one of your already limited skips. I have songs I liked months ago still showing up, regardless of whether they're in my playlist or not. Songs that I don't want to hear constantly. This makes it difficult to discover new music without wasting my time.
I understand that as a free user I shouldn't be able to skip everything, but making me deal with this is insult to injury. The least you could do is take these songs out of the queue, or allow us to ""unlike"" them.",anon1946372
Spotify,2022-09-09 16:49:21,New ideas for enhance feature!,5,"Let me start by saying I LOVE the enhance feature. It’s allowed me to find so many new songs that I adore and also create some banger playlists. As someone who listens to music religiously, and especially in the car, I’ve come across a problem. When I’m driving and I have my playlist enhanced, if a new song starts playing, it’s quite difficult to find that song in the playlist so that I can click the + button to add it. So I propose two new ideas! 

1) a “quick add” feature so that you can add the enhanced song to your playlist directly while you’re viewing the song in full screen, which would also add the 3 recommended songs

2) a “show this song in playlist” feature that automatically scrolls to the right spot in your playlist, allowing you to click the + button and then see the 3 recommended songs after

This would drastically increase the quality of life for me and others who listen to music all the time, but aren’t always able to spend a minute scrolling through my 20 hour long playlist trying to carefully spot the song that’s playing. Obviously I could just use the 3 dots and click “add to playlist” but then I don’t get the 3 recommended songs!!! All in all this is such a good feature and I love this app- these are just suggestions:)",Jdbrougham
Spotify,2022-04-01 23:04:25,Not all bad,5,"The app is good, sure the adds are repetitive and annoying, and not everyone can get premium so they sometimes have this add you watch to get 30 minutes no adds, which is really cool. You can choose your playlist via it be one you make or another persons. The only problem I really have it buying premium it’s self, you guys acknowledged it’s not ideal that you can’t buy it in the app but only on website. I tried many times buy premium from the website, I did try to use a Visa gift card so that may have been a problem but I was still trying to give you guys money and it didn’t work through your app. You guys should really let people buy premium through the app like many other apps that have subscriptions.

Spotify,2020-03-22 08:38:29,Equalizer Improvements-Best music app around!,5,"By far my favorite music streaming service. However the equalizer function is important to me as I frequently adjust it in order to get the best sound quality. The function is overall good but a way to save custom equalizer settings would make it much more user friendly. Additionally, placing it in a more accessible location would be extremely helpful. Currently it is buried in Settings->Playback->Equalizer forcing one to exit whatever they are doing to adjust sound settings. I hope to see either Playback Settings added to the Now Playing screen’s “three dot” menu or an additional “Equalizer” button created—opening Spotify’s equalizer over the current screen. This would allow the user to return to where they were immediately and greatly improve the app’s sound customization ability.",wildviolet99

However, no matter what I tried from your suggestions in help page app is still giving issues. I always wait for another update thinking that might be it. Phone is up to dare. Been logged out and logged back in and reset the phone. Reinstalled app. But it still gives me issues at least twice a day. 
You guys should find a way to communicate better with your customers and fix issues if they have one. If it continues like this, I have no other choice but to cancel subscription as I don’t want to pay for something that doesn’t work.

Spotify,2023-02-06 00:57:08,Update completely ruined the app,3,"The app was great up until the update came out. It completely changed the playlist layout, they removed the “queue” button along with the “up next” button, you can’t view and remove the songs added with enhance and there is no longer a button to turn off enhance at all. The new way to view the playlist makes it so that you can't skip directly to a specific song and instead makes it so you have to skip through the playlist to find that specific song. When you try to skip directly to a song, it only plays a clip of the song. Also, when you try to search for a song it plays a “recommended” song instead and won't let you listen to the song you actually clicked on. Sorry for the wall of text, but I do hope that the devs change the app back to how it was before the update. Once again, sorry for the wall of text. And the repetitive use of the word “song”.",FayWolfe
Spotify,2020-05-13 00:32:28,My Biggest Problem,4,"I got this app so I can play music without having to wait till someone is done playing music on an app so then I can.  { PROBLEM }.  I have only one problem , it’s that when I finish playing a song it goes to another random one but that’s not the problem. It’s when i play a song then when I go to play other song it keeping playing, then when I pause the song that I want to listen to, it then pauses the song that I didn’t want to listen too. So I have a hard time switching between songs because it would just play the same one and pause it when I’m trying to play another one. Overall I really like the app but that’s problem now, it’s just really bugging me. Tbh I don’t know if anyone has this problem like me but it’s just ruining my experience a little.

Spotify,2019-12-21 20:48:05,Could Be Better,3,"For starters, this app is really good at fulfilling it’s purpose of the whole music aspect. Like you are able to sort songs into your own playlists and follow your favorite artists. However, this is app is not perfect. The fact that you are able to sort songs in playlists is great, but I find it frustrating how random songs will “recommend” or just play random songs that you have probably never even heard of or put into your playlists. Also, the ads are too much. For example, the “30 minutes of no ads” ad pops up every two or so songs. And if you  choose not to to watch the short video, two or three ads will come up afterwards as to say “You should have watched the video”. If this were more like the desktop version, where you able to pick your songs, get unlimited amount of skips,  rewind or skip into songs, all while have a pretty small amount of ads compared to the mobile version, I think this app would be much more enjoyable to use whenever.",promingi_
Spotify,2019-09-22 00:17:58,This app could be so good but...,4,"This app could be so good, but for some unknown reason they want to shoot themselves in the foot.  It seems the playlists want at least 15 songs in them or the fill the rest with crap you don’t want to hear.  Then it only plays the crappy songs and they only allow 6 skips a day. If it just wants to play the crappy ones I might as well just tune in to a radio station I don’t like and save myself the trouble of making all the cool playlists.  I’m not getting to listen to what I want anyway...

Need to allow 20-30 skips a day & allow smaller playlists.  Also getting to listen to one full length song of your choice, instead of waiting to hear it after going through the entire playlist would really help with ones frustration when using the app.  Fixing 2 or 3 small problems would make this a really cool app, don’t even mind the ads, but the way it is I am being generous in giving this 2 stars out of 5...",ambulanceradio
Spotify,2019-01-28 21:06:19,Annoying.,5,"I don’t like to spend money on apps such as games and music apps but premium 🙄. I am not buying premium. It’s just no ads and all that. Well, why can’t you just make like 10 times less ads you know, maybe it would be less annoying.
Next, why can’t I just search for songs on my playlists instead of having to scroll through my 344+ song playlist. I have a life you know! 
Also, why do the same darn ads keep coming on! I memorized some. That’s when you know they have to stop playing the same ads! 
There are more problems but those are ones that bother me the most. I have never seen an app with this many ads. 
Anyways, I rated this a 3 because I at least get music but I listen to more ads then music and I know I should buy premium but I will not because I would like to see these problems fixed.
P.S. Another problem I have is lack of skips! I need more skips for the songs I dislike. I don’t like having to go to a different playlist just to listen to another bad song or having to suffer through that song. Oh and surprise! I can’t find the song on my playlist because I cannot search it on my playlist and I am busy!

Spotify,2019-06-14 23:05:33,"Edit: Great Service, bad update to Recently Played",1,"The newest update changed the path taken from the “Recently Played” icons, which used to send you to your saved collection of that artist’s work. Now clicking on a recently played artist takes you to that artist’s page, rather than your saved collection of that artist’s work. I understand that this can help users discover more of the new music, but I have specific songs saved for a reason: they are the songs by that artist I enjoy and want to listen to again. Please change it back or make this a user prompted option. Otherwise the GUI is intuitive and helpful.

*** Edit 6/14 (Switching 4 stars to 1): When I wrote this review several months ago, I was slightly annoyed by the new GUI in the recently played. Boy, I did not realize how much worse it could get. This new update almost makes the app unusable for someone trying to find their music in any way similar to what has been standard for the last 5 years.

But, I’d like one features to be added: Removing/hiding the “Episodes for you” option. I don’t even listen to episodes, and yet they keep popping up. There’s this one that’s very inappropriate that’s lingering in the for you section, which makes no sense because, again, I don’t listen to that many episodes. Especially not inappropriate ones. It would be helpful if you could also remove episodes from your watch history, because the few times I did listen to them, I hated most of them and now they just won’t go away.

Spotify,2022-12-26 22:18:45,Apple Watch Suffers,3,"It’s such a struggle to use this app on the Apple Watch. I am using the Ultra and the two main issues I have are the following:

1) Downloads:
When downloading with the watch connected to a phone it for some reason just forever shows the downloading circle looping but never downloads the music. When it does download I’ve had issues where I’m completely disconnected from my phone and I press play on my watch on a downloaded playlist and the play screen doesn’t update. It just never plays even though in Bluetooth my headphones are connected. Finally you can’t download single podcast episodes from the watch which is quite annoying.

2) listening 
It was a nightmare where I have a 50/50 chance of my headphones connecting to my watch when my phone is nearby. Half the time when I try to switch to my watch it just says “failed to connect try again later. Additionally, for some reason when I’m running disconnected from my phone after about 2-3 songs in the music just stops playing but the timer keeps going, when I press stop it goes back to the start of the song and when I press play it plays nothing but the timer ticks down and when I press pause it he same thing happens again and again until I just choose a new song or force restart.

I love the iPhone app but the Apple Watch especially in its offline mode is just insufferable to use a lot of the time.",RA1B0W55

Do whatever you want but I just wanna listen to my music without all these annoying interruptions and frustrations. It’s difficult and annoying to deal with.

However, I’ve been having a terrible problem with random shuffling. I go to play a song in my “liked songs”, and once the song is through it jumps back to the very first song in the list. I have 500+ songs I’ve liked, and for some reason it resets each time a song completes. It’s so frustrating! It’s really bad in Car View - I could be jamming in my car and then have to manually change it to the next song I want to listen to instead of having it play in order. And no, it’s not on shuffle.

Spotify,2021-06-07 16:44:53,Awful app,1,"It worked great for the first few weeks, but after that, it became the worst music app I’ve seen. First off, you cant rewind or repeat song’s, so you can only listen to the song once until it comes up on the playlist again. Second, instead of playing the actual song, it gives you a playlist with the song in it. If i wanted a playlist, i would play a playlist. Third, it adds songs to your custom playlist. If i didnt put it on the playlist, it means i dont want it on the playlist. Fourth, it stops playing a song in the middle of it, and when you try to keep playing it, it restarts the whole song. And finally, it has this stupid glitch where there’s no play button for the songs. I tried everything to fix it. I restarted the app, restared my phone, turning the wifi off and on again, using cellular data, but nothing worked. It wasnt something with the internet, because my other apps worked fine. After three days of waiting for the glitch to get fixed, I finally deleted it from my phone. I recommend using any other music app.",multi-fandomteen

In order to view the songs within an album I need to go to the artist profile and open the album from there. So the issues is if I have no internet I have downloaded music to listen to but if the album I want to listen to isn’t showing up as downloaded I can’t go to the artist profile because I’m offline. You may say then just download it again or may I don’t have it downloaded. When I go to the album from the artist profile it shows all the songs are downloaded the album also appears in the album section as well so like.

Spotify,2019-05-28 01:29:31,its okay.,3,"1st problem, the limited skips. on iphone you have 6 or 7 skips per hour. thats bull. so if you just dont like a song on ur playlist that day, you have to use a skip.
2nd problem. the recomending songs. instead of playing the playlist over again it gives u recomended songs. i understand the idea of that, but idk its just not executed well.
3rd problem, playing a playlist over again is too much work. ok so if a playlist just ended and u wanted to listen to it again, you cant click “ shuffle play” again, you have to play another playlist, then click shuffle play on that playlist, then go back to the playlist you want to play again THEN click shuffle play. 
4rth problem. THE AMOUNT OF ADS. OMG THERE ARE TOO MANY. there are ads dor every 8 songs i think, but theres a skip ad button and even if u click the button that says “SKIP” WICH YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SKIL THE AD, IT DOESNT AND JUST PLAYS THE AD. anyways, overall the app is good, but if u have the opportunity to have apple music instead, go with apple music.",maddy durot
Spotify,2019-02-28 10:32:56,Dislike new update,2,"Updated recently and the changes made to operating are frustrating. My normal use, is listening to my downloaded playlists. Before, I could select a song and the “shuffle” option would stay on. This no longer happens, so it would play the order it’s in (alphabetical, easier to find by title). If you play outside the “queue” it will play in order no matter what.
My second issue which is even more frustrating, if when searching for a song within a playlist, the only music it will play is within that search. My most used playlist has 270+ songs, but a search for let’s say “Post Malone” will bring up all matches, but when I select, it will only play “Post Malone” instead of other songs on the playlist. 
Third, there was a step added to opening the queue. Before, you could pull up the “Now Playing” screen and just click on queue. Another step was added, not a big deal but feel it is not needed. The queue also also goes away after the next song starts which also did not happen before.",Geores92

What’s the point in making a playlist if I can’t even hear what the song is. Losing this feature just makes the app a bit more useless in my opinion. I honestly don’t care for the adds but I do dislike that it plays the ad and then another for 10-15 seconds saying that I won’t be interrupted for 30 minutes. If you just left it at one ad I wouldn’t get so irritated for it taking up so much time.

I LOVE this app it’s like a library o f songs and podcasts I do recommend this app and it’s free other than Apple Music. I just love it how you have a kid’s  version so it’s safe. I just don’t know how to explain how good this app is! Now I will be moving to the negative side but it’s not a lot of problems. First of all why do you add songs to my playlist like I didn’t ask you like I’m not trying to be rude but I don’t know any songs that you added. I’m pretty much picky about stuff that I don’t have a lot of interest of since I’m making a playlist that includes hip hop and beats but I don’t have a lot of interest of hip hop since it’s kind of negative to me.

Spotify,2020-11-23 02:52:48,APP KEEPS PAUSING MUSIC - can’t deal anymore,1,"Then: for the first 6 months of having this app it was 5 star with great selection and working exactly as advertised. I got a premium subscription and I put it on my iPhone, my windows laptop, my Roku tv and my car. When I would go to my car the song just picked up from where I left off in my house, it was beautiful.

Now: for the last month or so, at least once a day, playback will just randomly pause. Like after 5 seconds, pause. I hit play and the song will play for ~ 10-20 seconds and pause again. Sometimes I do this twice and the song plays through other times it’ll pause 5 times in a row until I just give up. I have many downloaded songs on my phone, they pause too, so it’s not the connection. I have googled every potential fix from community support, I’ve re-installed the app several times, signed out of every instance on every device and after about a day the pause bug comes back on every platform I use.

So, mainly, I have a problem with not having enough skips to get through those songs I don’t want in my playlist in the first place. I’m not sure if this is an option when you get a subscription, (I do know you get skips), but it will be much easier if the app just didn’t add random songs that I never wanted in my playlist.

Usually if you press a song (without shuffle on) it would just go down the order of “Recently added” or however “you” have your songs listed. Now if you press on a song and go all the way through that song it won’t go in the order it’s supposed to, it’ll take you back to the song all the way at the top of the list which is the last song “I” added to my list. (My Order of songs is on “Recently added”) so imagine if I’m in the middle of the list of my songs it’ll take me to the last song i added which is at the very beginning of my list. And if I ever had my music on Shuffle it wouldn’t shuffle every song that’s in my list. It will shuffle every song within this small gap instead of shuffle my songs from the very top of the list to the very bottom.

There are only two downsides to this app. Lately when it offers the 30mins of unlimited listening without adds and I click to watch the add it just goes right back to my music and doesn’t let me listen without adds. The other thing is that I don’t have the money to pay for the monthly Prime. I’m only 16 I don’t have a job or a bank account that I can pay for the unlimited music. Yes, I understand that they have to have some way to pay for the app to still be up I just wish there was another way for me to get the unlimited music without adds and be able to listen offline. But other than those two things I love this app and would recommend it to anyone.",BM022020
Spotify,2020-08-22 22:40:13,"Love it but,,,,,,,,",3,"I don't have that many complaints. I really like this app. But,,,,,,there's a REALLY big problem. Its randomly skips songs, changes playlists, and kicks me out of the app and I didn't touch anything. Thats a problem. Also, it keeps pausing randomly when I don't want it to. And it keeps making this very, very strange noise randomly and I can't do anything. And I have to constantly log out so it won't happen when I'm not on. And one more thing. Whenever I close the app, it would still play music even though I CLOSED THE APP. And these things don't happen once in a while. These things happen EVERY SINGLE DAY.I updated the app and even deleted it and reinstalled it to see if that would fix it but no luck. Maybe it's a glitch? Maybe it's a bug? Maybe my hacker/stalker/FBI agent is trolling me? Or maybe it's something else that the people who run this app need to fix, I don't know. But please fix it or else I'll have to delete it permanently or I might break my phone out of anger. So yeah. Please fix it. 😑💅🏾",i want more chedder
Spotify,2022-05-05 03:31:41,Good but ads need some work,5,"It’s great! It gives you the lyrics and you can find every song in here and I love it and use it all the time. But it feels like they’re really trying to force you to get premium. Because the ads are unbearable. They come up like after every 3 songs and usually there’s about 2 30 second ones, and it always says that if you watch it it’ll give 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening. Haven’t ever tested that, but from what it felt like it certainly did never felt like 30 minutes. Every time I have my playlist on an ad comes on I just leave the room and go grab a snack or something. So I would love it if they were able to just maybe allow some shorter ads. There are a few like five second ones, but they’re rare. But I would recommend! Especially if you can afford the premium.",Mayo is Pog
Spotify,2018-11-15 23:41:39,Mmm,2,"So, one it won’t even let me install the app on my iPad, it keeps saying an unknown error has occurred please try again. So I do, and it still doesn’t work. Two, the actual app has way too many ads, for example there is one that says “Tap now to get 30 minutes with no ads” so obviously I click it while thing ends, I listen to my song, and boom. Ad. Right there in the middle of my listening. Three, I feel like you don’t have enough skips or that there is something in the algorithm that makes it so you have all of the songs you don’t want to listen to and then you land on a song you hate (if that makes any sense at all) I believe it’s only 5 skips but even still. Four, I don’t like how it just takes a short playlist of your, say 5 songs, and when you play it, it plays ‘suggested songs’. I have a playlist so that I can listen to all the songs I want one right after the other, not so that you can just be like oH hEy, LeTs PlAy ThIs SoNg nOw.

Now you could see all the songs in a playlist three weeks ago so change it back in my opinion you’re going to gain more listeners that way. I would’ve given this a five star review if it would’ve been kept as it was I really hope you read this review and change the app back so everybody can see the songs in their playlists and just premium customers because in my opinion that’s valuing a certain set of people more.",Emily🖤🦄

And you can’t Dismiss ones you don’t like. Some are an accidental touch and now they stay in the list. I pay for this for now so please improve the postcast experience! I don’t want to make a playlist of podcasts that are already a list. I would also like to be able to see the date of the episode more easily, since I listen to podcasts that started years ago and have hundred of episodes.

Spotify,2020-10-21 19:36:45,Issues with auto play unresolved,1,"Don’t know what triggered it but I had a premium account and out of nowhere, although I keep all my apps updated and my iOS system on my XR updated, auto play just decides not to work or work only sometimes. Customer support won’t solve my issue and I’ve reached out 4 times and not been followed up with. Tried deleting cache, deleting and redownloading the app and even setting up a new account. I pay for premium and expect auto play to keep working and playing songs after I search and play a song-this is how I discovered many new artists before I started running into this issue about a month and a half ago where it just flat out stops playing after one song. Ignored by customer service and not followed up with either when they say they’ll “hand it off to the specialty team.” Even worse that their service dept doesnt have a co-browse solution so I can screen share and show them exactly what I’m talking about, nor describe it over the phone since there’s no number to call.

Spotify,2020-06-26 13:14:30,More inventory please,5,"Lots of great playlists but I often find some of my favorite albums and those songs are not included. Love the “this is...” playlists, but often they do not include the best songs from an artist. Search function is mandatory but is quite slow and clunky. You have to spell names exactly right and complete. Anticipatory window should be included to speed search. I don’t like the 30 second preview on my phone at all. Make it a buried option, not the first thing that comes up. But I love the fact this works independently on my Roku tv. I will likely upgrade to premium after finding employment. Thanks for providing to us free for those of us who can’t afford it... great service!
Have now updated to premium. Still love it. Wish the Roku and iPhone apps worked now the same way. But it’s getting better all the time!...",Audioman4God
Spotify,2017-11-16 23:25:47,Great App but Preview Feature Is Gone!,4,"I love this app. It’s my primary music platform and has been for years now. I’m a premium subscriber and think it’s a great value for what you get, at least if you listen to even half as much music as I do (which is a lot, admittedly, but still...$10 a month of unlimited access to all songs, all playlists I or any other user has ever created, etc, all for the price of a single iTunes album? I used to buy at least one and sometimes tons more each month on iTunes. Now I pay $10 and that’s it. Nice. 

So why only 4 stars? They took my beloved Preview feature away. I loved being able to tap and hold on a particular song and hear a good 30 seconds of it without actually having to add it to the queue or play it all the way through. Or tap an album and preview most or all of the songs on it before committing to actually playing everything in full. It was great. And I want it back. Please?",Ebr2002
Spotify,2022-05-28 03:16:18,Love it but I really would like this fixed…,4,"I have used this app for years but I am getting tired of a few things. 1: I love to listen to my likes songs, but it is hard to enjoy it because at the end of my playlist, it plays suggested tracks which are usually inappropriate or dark. I really hate having to listen to a playlist that I know is good but that I don’t want to listen to at that moment. 2: I am fine with ads. I have never had a problem with them but, sometimes it feels like I am watching 10 ads to listen to 1 song. And the ads I have to listen to are stuff like California Scratchers, which isn’t interesting to an underage teen. It would be nice if there could be a little less ads and not to repeat the same ad over and over again. 
Thank you if you read this, and please fix these issues. I love to listen to music but I have nowhere else to enjoy it. 🎸",Kai from Ninjago
Spotify,2021-05-14 22:35:59,Switching to Apple Music,1,"The only pro about this entire app (isn't much tbh) is that there are podcasts that are exclusive to the app. I can't listen to a song that I want, because when I tap it, it plays 3-8 completely unrelated songs before. If I put songs into a playlist, it won't let me listen to them until it has played at least 4 other recommended songs. Sometimes the genres of the songs will be completely different too. And I can't listen to any song without having to hear an ad that says I'll be able to ""enjoy the next 30 min of ad-free music"" which comes up again after 1-2 songs. The Daily Mix's would be a nice feature since you can skip and select songs that aren't on shuffle, if only it didn't remove songs from them if I listened to them too much. I'm tired of putting up with this trash app. It tries to annoy you into paying, but I'd rather not pay such a joke of a company. Oh, and another thing, they pay their artists 57% less than what Apple pays their artists, and Apple Music has way more artists on their platforms.",o_bombYT
Spotify,2021-03-16 23:36:34,Bug,3,"I’ve used this app for about 9 years and recently for a few weeks my songs have been stopping half way and I have to open back up the app to play the song from the beginning. This has happened multiple times when trying to listen to one song. Also the ads that say click to watch a video for 30 min free ads have been popping up within 2-3 songs without me skipping. Not sure if this helps but I’m using an iPhone 11 pro. 
     Aside from the bugs it’s not cool that we can’t pick and choose songs we want on the phone, that we have to wait till the song randomly shuffles into our playlist. Or when we choose the song we want other related songs play fist before we get to the song we are trying to choose. 
     On computer it’s great, I can get through 15 minutes worth of music until I hear an ad and I can skip 6 times till another ad appears, then skip some more. Also on computer you can choose the song you want to hear right away.",Neimadalucard

I don’t have premium. I have family premium so my whole family can  listen to there music freely and we really enjoy it with this premium you can play any song you want, you don’t get ads, you have unlimited skips and you can download the whole playlist you have and play it without in internet if you download them so you could listen to them on a airplane ✈️. I hope if you download this app you like it❤️😊",Ktdew
Spotify,2020-04-19 18:13:59,It’s a 5 star but I have to give it a 4,5,I use this app and prefer it over Apple Music. I’ve had premium for as long as I can remember and it’s so nice. Finding new music is easier than Apple Music because you can click a song and hit go to song radio or album radio and it suggests songs like it and that’s how I discover more. Only reason I give it 4 stars is that recently the app has been crashing while I’m listening and that has never happened before but now it’s happening more often and it’s really annoying all I have to do is reopen the app and play the song and it’s fine but I wish I didn’t have this problem :/ anyways I highly suggest this music app I don’t think anything else compares I love my playlists and i love that I’ve discovered all my favorite songs through this app actually I'm going to give it 5 stars.,toralezamanda

Yes, I love how this app has practically EVERY song and genre, and nor do u have to pay to get just a single song to listen to! Now, I’ve been using this app for a few years now and the new update that they NOT recently released pretty much ruined it. For example: Whenever I search up a song that I would like to just simple listen to from the search bar, it plays a completely different one! Please PLEASE fix this!! It is so irritating. Another thing is that you guys removed the “repeat” button for when you want to listen to a song on repeat. Help! Lastly; before his update, whenever I opened for clicked on a playlist, it would open the playlist and show you all the songs, top to bottom, BUT NOW.. it doesn’t even do that! It just shows empty space and the title and info of the playlist and lists but doesn’t show the songs involved! Please please fix!!!",PxmpkinP1e
Spotify,2023-02-02 03:05:08,PLEASE stop fixing what isn’t broken,2,"Devs constantly push awful UI updates for no reason that are so bad and poorly thought out. Been a customer for a long time—nearly 10 years now and I’ve never been so close to deleting my account for good. As of the current version, there is a share button right above the song’s play bar and I constantly am pushing the button on accident when seeking through the current track around the middle of the song. Another gripe, why put the song album art in two places, the big one in the center of the screen and another smaller one right above it in the upper left corner of the screen? It’s aesthetically unpleasant and clutters the screen which further cramps the space needed  for actual functioning buttons (like the share button mentioned previously). Nonsensical UI updates that serve no purpose but to anger users leave me no choice but to not recommend this app as the go-to for a premium music-listening experience as it used to be.",Cgburns612

Recently, the music has been stopping randomly in the middle of songs. It started happening little by little. A song would play stop once then never again. But now, I played a song 5 times and it stopped again. What I mean by stopped is, that it would be like the app closed, but the tab was still there. That annoyed me a lot because every time I’m doing something on my phone while listening to music, it would stop. Then I’d have to leave the app and play it again. Also, every time I played the song again, it wouldn’t start from the beginning. It would start a second in, then two seconds, then three and etc. Please fix this bug! Over all though, I love this app! Keep up the good work!",Pupurp

BUT JUST ONE THING!!,5,"I absolutely love the app. Everything from recommending songs to me, keeping steady playlists for me to listen to, to updating music all the time. I HAVE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS! One, I would absolutely love it if there was a faster option to add music to your own PERSONAL playlist, as I love to create my own personal playlist for family and friends to listen to. On occasions, I frequently add music in playlists but usually end up being time inefficient. I was wondering if there was a faster way? And 2, for my own personal playlists, I would like to separate it from other playlists I follow from >Playlists >Music >Playlists. If possible, I would highly recommend having playlists you follow in a separate category and having your own personal playlists in their own category. That way it’ll be way more organized on keeping a clean plate if that makes sense. Thanks!",RECOMMENDATION?

However, there's been a really annoying glitch that doesn't allow me add more songs to a playlist I just created. The number of songs isn't even the issue because it will simply not register my tap and if it does it will freeze and not add the song to the newly created playlist. This has been going for a few weeks now. Apart from this there use to be an amazing preview feature that allowed you to press on a song without playing or queuing it and it'd give you a 30 second preview of it-please bring this back it saved a lot of time. Aside from these issues though I strongly recommend this app, especially if you decide on premium.

I used to love this app, I didn’t care if it was on a premium account or free but the last few updates made using the app a little unbearable in a few ways. There’s NO LONGER a ‘MY SONGS’ TAB which makes the app less pleasurable to use. I can no longer see SPECIFIC SOMGS under an artist WITHOUT HAVING to FOLLOW the artist and LIKE ALL of their songs. I literally go to my ‘ARTIST’ TAB and DON’T see ANY of the songs I like, and I’m FORCED to play ALL of the artist’s songs INSTEAD of the many that I only LIKE by the artist. I DON’t want to HAVE to make a PLAYLIST every time I want to hear only 23 of the 84 tracks from a single artist it’s RIDICULOUS. It also PLAYS the EXACT same SONGS over and over even when in shuffle. The updates took over half of my songs away and I’m LIVID. And it RANDOMLY plays songs and artists that have NOTHING to do with the playlist or genre I’m TRYING to listen to.

One commercial in particular has a woman loudly going PSSSS!!! PSSSS!!! as though whispering into your ear, only extremely loudly and with very painful sibilance.  It happens after a brief period of silence and if you are listening to gentle music it will make you jump in pain. My ear is ringing now and I wasn’t even using headphones or listening loudly on my tablet. Others have specifically complained about this commercial for at least two months and it is criminal that it is still being used. 

The FCC made this practice illegal for TV advertisements and it’s shameful that companies need to be forced into following common decency by legislation, rather than ensuring that both the listener and advertisers can live together in harmony.  What is the point in having commercials if the listener is going to tear out their headphones in pain or mute the volume in disgust?",Johnny Aloe Seed

The downside is that it uses data, and you can not choose the order it plays in. Still a great free app. I highly recommend the paid version. For $10 per month, you can save albums to your phone so you're not using data. You can play albums straight through, in order. You can also download podcasts, and videos, but I don't use those features. It's very intuitive and easy to use. I believe it offers new users the option to try it for 99 cents for 90 days. Do it!!

When reordering songs in the queue by dragging, they will flicker and the page refuses to scroll, making it very hard to reorder them. Sometimes the app even crashes when I try to do this. Also, the shuffle system is extremely flawed, as often times in a playlist songs by the same artist will play one after another, or conversely songs organized chronologically in a playlist will shuffle slightly but will gradually advance in time. For example, I have a chronological playlist by a single artist and the songs will usually shuffle by playing the oldest songs first and then gradually getting to the new ones, while still shuffling slightly between the songs.

It was working while I was working on things, but then the playlist was done and over with and randomly started playing different “suggested” songs.

Spotify,2021-06-08 14:29:22,Like it but it has too many ads without premium,3,"Sometimes I’ll be listening to music and after a song it gives me 3 15 second ads in a row and it really aggrivates me because if I want to play a different track, even though I already had to listen to 3 ads it still gives me three more. The only other problem I have is when it shows the songs in a playlist or album that’s not mine it only shows a few of the songs. If I want to know if a certain song is on a playlist I won’t have any way of knowing unless I listen to the entire thing and waste an hour of my time. Also sometimes while I’m listening to music a song will randomly stop and when I turn on my phone It says there’s no music being played. I got into the app and play the music again and it starts the song over for it to just stop in the middle again. I’m hoping this bug gets fixed soon because it really gets on my nerves.",shabloof
Spotify,2018-09-13 14:50:09,Love app but just a few tweaks,5,"I love the app! Last night I was listening to my songs on my library, I went to the queue to remove some songs I didn’t want to play next. It worked for a few but then as I removed more, they wouldn’t be removed of the list. I had to exit the app move around within the app and then try it again. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn’t. Please fix! 

Suggestion as well, I have so many songs in my personal library and every month or so my “favorite songs” frequently change. I wish we could “favorite songs” (maybe add a star or a heart for selection) and they would automatically be placed into a playlist. I know we can create playlists, I tried but it’s a hassle adding songs to playlists, that way I can easily enjoy which songs I listen to non-stop by just easily heart-ing or star-ring a song.",CES112
Spotify,2019-04-01 15:46:35,The app might as well be completely broken.,1,"There are an overwhelming number of negatives to positives with this app, it feels completely broken at best. I can listen to the songs I have saved hardly a fraction of the time, because otherwise the app completely floods me with suggested songs, and most of which have absolutely nothing in common with my saved songs. If I’m really lucky, I get about ten suggested songs for every two songs I have saved that the app lets me listen to. Most of the time though, it won’t even play a single song I have saved to any playlist, or even if I’m trying to directly listen to an album, or from an artist. If I mark certain songs not to be played, the app still plays them anyway, making that feature absolutely worthless. The ads, for some reason, are at least twice as loud as the songs. The menus feel clunky and inconvenient at best. The “don’t play this song” feature doesn’t work, the songs are still there and it still plays them regardless. This app is barely functioning, and it keeps getting worse with each update.",everyworthwhilenicknameistaken
Spotify,2022-01-01 03:09:02,Incredible! But…,5,"I love this app! It has many great features!
1. The playlists to share around with other people! You can them as long as you want with any songs you please.
2. All the different song choices is great as well, I can find almost every song I want. Sadly it fed the have some which is okay as well!
3. You can make these “story’s” and make them about anything you want. Which I think is really cool though I don’t Listen to them anymore.
4. How you can add your own pictures to your playlists, you can sometimes edits other playlists that people made, you can block songs if you don’t like them ( this choice is mostly for parents in my opinion.) you also can leave like on other playlists.
For the problem…
There are many ads. I know you want the money so you put in several ads so people will buy the premium but to be honest, not many people are going to want to especially sense some people come on here to escape the pay for other music apps. I am mostly okay with it but it also plays two 30 second ads which in my opinion is annoying, especially when you are taking a bath and just want to listen to some nice music.
I would recommend this app, but unless you don’t want to pay for a subscription, prepare for the ads.",Pikalillyrose

Isaiah was very knowledgeable about not only the Black Church, but he admitted that he at one time was a Reformed Theologist, rallying against the black church;   until he did his homework and followed the recommendation of a friend and read and researched the historical black churches for himself.  Pastor Isaiah immersed himself in those environments, and literature, and admittedly learned the value of the black culture, church, in relation to Christianity.
Therefore, Isaiah Robertson, encourages Western  Christians to read black seminary literature, visit black churches to “allow the evidence to speak for itself.”  Then, the  Western Christians will be able to see first hand, why, “Barnes Research,”  validates that Christianity is flourishing at a higher more resilient rate in the Black Churches as compared to the Western Christianity Churches.",Sis Myrt

The idea of hands free means I shouldn’t have to grab the phone, unlock it and open the app in order to resume playback.  Granted, I only use the app for JRE podcast, tried to switch all my podcasts to this app but found it annoying that there is no option for automatic download such as the apple podcast app lets you.

I have been able to use this app with the free account for the past few years and have really enjoyed it. Now, I’m going to have to say goodbye because of your update.

This app used to be the number one place I went to for my music, but I can’t do that now. Here’s a tip, if it isn’t broken, don’t fix it!

Spotify,2018-12-31 20:50:20,Review,4,"I terribly miss the feature where you can organize your playlist by artist, by song, and by album. Currently, on my playlists, it can be only be organized by you which is by when I added them, however I don't want some of my playlists to be organized like that. Also, I haven’t added a song to my playlists in a long while, partially because of how my playlists are automatically organized, because I can’t even listen an individual song before I add it to my playlists. I didn’t mind only listening to a part of a song like a long before, but not at all just frustrates me. Often I wish there was an un-update button for your app because sometimes there are some things you shouldn’t like update. I don’t even know if premium will get me back these features. I’ve looked into it, it just doesn’t say that it will. If it did then I would make the switch to premium, but it doesn’t.",Marshmelliw1
Spotify,2023-03-22 06:47:03,Almost perfect,4,I’d give it 5 stars but I’m gonna give it 4 stars. The main  reason I don’t give it 5 stars is because I when you add a song to the playlist it gets added to the bottom so I have to drag it from the bottom to the top. Idk why a app that I pay for doesn’t allow people to have the option to automatically add a song to either the top or bottom. Since I’m already complaining their is a small issue with where it frequently won’t let me add a song to a playlist which I could understand if you refreshed the app and it let you but I’ve tried that many times to no avail. This leads to me liking a song while driving (because it’s easier than adding it while driving) and then a couple of songs I forget about which isn’t really a big deal at all it’s just a inconvenience that I would imagine they would of fixed by now.,Humpy Trumpy

Great quality audio and my favorites musicians are here all of them. I love this app so much! I have my favorites albums all in one app I can hear music all day without buy it... it's just awesome! I have the free option and the way this guys managing ads is great... Thanks for the hard work! Keep it up. All that above was set it up by the app itself, but they read my mind that’s what I think about this great app, I have found music on here that I never ever thought I’ll be able to find with a great audio quality, music that my great, great grandpa told me that his grandpa used heard it in his younger days.

Before when I got the app I was able to listen to the music I wanted by clicking on the song. But now when I try and do that it starts shuffling music from other genres instead of the one I clicked. I can’t seem to turn off shuffle mode either, which is weird because I never turned it on in the first place. You should really fix that part of the app because if I click on a song to listen to I expect that song to play, not some other song that also fits its genre. Everything else about the app is fine, just please fix this one thing… it’s very frustrating for someone like me having music be something to clan me down. It was easier to listen to it on this app before that shuffle thing happened.",That one girl😈

It’s up was good for a while but then this one update happened and it messed the whole app up like I just want to make a good playlist but now it wants to add tenSongs that I don’t even know to this playlist and also you have to pay to skip songs that you don’t like so even if you deal with those random songs on your playlist you have to pay to skip like over six of them you have absolutely no control with this app when you try to listen to a song it’s shuffle songs together there’s absolutely no reason for it as if you’re not for paying premiumWhy shouldn’t mess up your entire experience this is just a scam making you pay however much money per month",floatinghippo1234

I don’t have Premium and I don’t plan on getting it mainly because it works so much better on my computer. I can’t listen to a specific song on the app because I have to sort through like 5 or more seemingly random songs to finally play what I originally wanted, and the fact that there are only 6 skips an hour makes it harder. I’m fine with shuffle being always on for non-Premium users as long as it would stop playing suggested songs before and after the song I wanted (although not being able to loop a song really bugs me sometimes) Other than that, I don’t mind the ads too much except there are like 3 thirty second ads sometimes??

Spotify,2020-02-19 14:59:27,"Good selection of songs, but WAY to many commercials",3,"As far as Music selection and quality of sound goes its a great app. Yet if you can’t afford to get the paid version basically every 5 songs you get to listen to 1.5 mins of commercials! Every once in a while the will offer you to watch a commercial and not have adds for 30mins. I wish they offered it more often, because sometimes in a 30min span (if you are unlucky an don’t get an offer you watch a video) you will have listened to 9 commercials! Then I swear every time you change your play list they restart all commercials. For example l watch a video in exchange for 30 mins of no adds, but I decided a few mins after doing this to switch playlist. When I did, I got commercials again and it had only been 10 mins :/
Asides from the adds though, it is a great app, so if you can afford the monthly version I would recommend it otherwise many pandora is better for free listening.",Graciegettinghitched

Also it’s ridiculous that you can’t just select a song a listen to it without paying, and that random songs that you probably don’t like are added to playlists with no way to remove them.  I feel like being able to listen offline, with no ads, and unlimited skips would be plenty for a premium membership, but to make it so the experience is completely miserable unless you pay just stinks. 

Also fairly frequently when listening to my playlist of liked songs the app seems to just decide it’s no longer going to play anything at all that I’ve actually selected and just starts playing song after song after song of random junk that I have no interest in. It’s not even like they just threw an unwanted few songs into my playlist, it’s like it’s just completely ignoring the playlist altogether. I then have to force quit and relaunch the app to fix it.

I’ve used both the free version and premium and I’ve been using it since 2016 and it has never failed me. I will make a suggestion though, I know you guys have the whole watch this commercial for thirty minutes of music and I love that but it would be awesome if some of the commercials rewarded us with one free skip ever now and then. I make this suggestion because when you use the free version you have 6 skips and if you only want to hear one song by whoever off whatever album those skips go pretty quick since you can’t just pick the song you want unless you pay and not everyone is willing or able to do that plus the commercials are repetitive and that can be annoying to no end so maybe reward us for our patience 😊 I really do love this app though.",ms.hyde

You’re given three options: playlists, artists, or albums. There is no way to play the already downloaded music without being forced to go to the specific album which when you tap the song will continue to play the rest of the album even if you don’t want to listen to it. Just add back the tab for the music that is already on your device like previous updates. Without that option, there is literally no point in having a premium membership as there is no easy way to access your music at all. There is a playlists of your liked songs, but that is no where as easy as it used to be. This is a serious UI problem that needs to be addressed quickly.",joe155255

Also 6 skips per hour?! To me that doesn't make sense to me why 6 why such a little number at least make it 12 or 10 just why 6 
Something else is that please stop adding songs to my track i don't want your recommended songs i know which songs i want bot only that but come on You Cant Even Remove it!!!! I don't want to listen to your recommended songs trust me i know what i want to listen to.

And, there’s already a tab for it in my library, right there!

I go to “browse” for OTHER playlists and see what else is popular in the world, beyond my bubble. The “tailored” playlists aren’t “innovation”, it’s just another echo chamber. 

Also, y’all clearly take a ton of analytics on the music I listen to... but I can’t have a play count on my playlists, or see any of my usage like iTunes allows? I don’t need to be offered a “tailored” playlist that’s 95% songs I already have in a personal playlist, but it’d be nice for me to be able to actually reflect on what I listen to and how often - beyond the terrible “year in review” playlists that get pushed out every December.",an avid user
Spotify,2018-08-09 23:32:27,Annoyed,2,When I first had this app it’s was great I could look up what ever song and wanted and play it right then and there but the app changed and I can’t play the song I want when I want I have to shuffle through the playlist and if I don’t like a song in the playlist and try to hit shuffle again it won’t change the song so I have to listen to stuff I don’t want to. Also when you go to your personal playlist you have to shuffle instead of chose the song you want to listen to even though it’s your own playlist and it should let you click on a song and listen to it. The extra songs in your playlist are also annoying because I just want to listen to the songs I chose and not something so coming back to the shuffle issue when it shuffles to the extra songs area I can’t change to song even if I press shuffle again and end up listening to music I’ve never heard or like.

The most annoying one is while using the search feature the back navigation buttons can disappear. It’s then impossible to go back and do another search. The app will eventually reset and make search available again but only if you force quit the app (which doesn’t always work) or wait a while until iOS restarts the app on its own. This is a major bug and I hope they fix soon. Another problem is that long titles get cut off in most screens and there’s really no way to see them. They definitely need to fix that. Also, I’m very glad they included an EQ. They didn’t have to do that; major props for doing so.

I listen to one song maybe twice and it’s suddenly EVERYWHERE. It would be amazing if I could reset both search history and listening history. Resetting back to one would allow for new discoveries in music. It feels like a music bubble. This app is fast becoming not worth the premium price tag. Pandora isn’t it...but at half the price and given I’ve discovered more amazing new music and come to this app to add it to a playlist, maybe I should make Pandora my primary app. My thoughts.

Spotify,2017-09-30 21:49:04,Great App With Room for Improvement,4,"So, I love this app. I’m a college student and I love how premium is only $4.99/month. However, there are some things I wish yall would improve about this app:
1. When we are listening to a playlist and do a search to add something to the queue, as soon as we add the song it closes the search. If I want to add multiple songs by one artist I have to do the search again and again. Just keep the search up until we are done adding to the queue and let us close it. I don’t think that would be hard to add.
2. After adding a song to the queue and the playlist moves on to the next song, if we go back to listen again it goes to the song that came on before the song added to the queue. Just keep it in the queue, sometimes I want to listen to a song multiple times.

Pay a monthly subscription of $9.99. To listen to a specific song. And get unlimited skips. At that point it’s not even worth using the app. And you also have to go onto their website in order to even get premium. You can’t get it through the app. You also can’t listen to one playlist in order. Because the non-shuffle feature is also a part of premium. It’s really annoying too.

Also I’m not sure if this is a bug, but songs don’t start to play unless you click on them twice now, which is pointless. All the recent changes are bad, please go back to how things were before, ESPECIALLY the “recently played” section that showed artists/playlists/songs/albums/radio stations, etc. and gave you the option to edit and remove them from the page.

And by that I mean I have alot of songs together or even just all my liked songs and it happens to be choosing the same songs every time. If there was a way to make sure it chooses a different song every time I click the shuffle it would be amazing.

Spotify,2022-03-19 05:39:25,Multiple Issues,2,This app has a few quality features that make it very nice but a few issues with some basic functions that I just can not over look. To start with pros it should be noted that many many people use this app so there are many songs put out by people that you can not find on other music apps. Plus you can find many varieties of playlists which is great! The cons that I can not ignore is how poorly I have found the workings of their playlist functions to be. I can not add new playlists on my phone or laptop nor can I delete or edit them. It says I have deleted something but it never goes away. So it is very irritating in that way which could be ignored if it were not such a basic feature. The other issue is I have tried reaching out about the issue but have found myself waiting for a response for quite some time.

Or maybe liking a song and just not having the feature to go back, it’s so frustrating and has made me want to delete the app on multiple occasions. 
And the library thing, why are you putting artists that I follow in my library and playlists together, I have to press the filter button which goes away right as I exit the app, it’s so annoying and cluttered, and as a perfectionist and somebody who has to have everything organized, it’s makes me want to scream. Like make a button just for the artists or something, it’s rlly annoying. 
I really hope you fix these problems, there are some nice things about this app, but the problems just ruin the whole experience. :/",Cassie_Offical
Spotify,2020-04-07 00:07:49,Downloads and podcast binging,3,"This music service is great! I love the playlists, availability of my favorite artists, and listening across multiple platforms. The app falls short currently in three places for me. Where I live is rural - No cell service, bad wifi. I keep some music and a few episodes of podcasts downloaded so I can listen between home and the glorious land of data, but one of the more recent updates makes downloads not register sometimes. It spins and says I have no internet connection and never shows my downloads. Force quitting the app works 70% of the time, but normally I will have made it to cell service by the time it comes back. 

When trying to binge my favorite podcasts from the beginning to catch up to real time, the app trys to always throw me to the newest one (or episode 0). When trying to go from phone to windows client, listen history is so messed up that I have to use the play progression bars to figure out which one I'm actually on.",Leaptrot
Spotify,2019-12-28 16:15:36,Great for computers horrible for phones.,3,"This app is incapable of using shuffle mode. It’s good for listening to music, which is why I’m giving 3 stars because it does what it says it supposed to do. But the ads are making me furious. I get you can get premium to get rid of ads and skip. But I don’t mind listening to ads and I don’t care about skipping songs. So to me it seems like a waste of money. But when I’m with my family listening to music, I DO NOT want to hear ads about CONDOMS and PERIOD PADS. It’s inappropriate for some of the members of my family. And I’m tired of hearing them. I’m a female. I get periods are a regular thing. Nothing against periods. But I don’t believe my 8 year old brother needs to hear about periods and condoms. Both are very important I feel. But not so much you have to play the ad after every 2-3 songs. It’s irritating, it’s embarrassing, and reporting them does absolutely nothing. There is no explicit filter for ads. I almost just want to stop using it. It’s so irritating.",Likeaboss6600

Except for the fact that I can't choose them. If I use my tablet or computer then I can pick what songs I want to listen to but if I'm using my iPhone then I'm stuck with whatever song they give me when I hit shuffle. That includes all the ""discover new songs"" that they play. I understand giving a few suggestions every now and then but it is ridiculous because if you have less than 10 songs in your playlist, odds are you won't even hear your songs, just music that doesn't relate to your playlist. I get how Premium would allow you to download and remove ads. I wouldn't even mind it if you had to get it to pick a specific track. But at least let me choose to go back a song or just let me play songs in my playlist. Also, they offer a 30 minute ad free thing every now and then but it doesn't work.",L.I.L.

Well, no. Cuz once the free trial ran out to listen to the full song, the playlist would be on shuffle and you would have to wait till the song came on. And when you clicked on the song, it would play like 6 seconds of it and then would stop playing that. Also once the free trial ran out you got to skip 6 songs per hour. And the app says well you can just upgrade to premium and so you are like alright I’ll get premium and then be able to click on a song and listen to it right there and then. No. It legit says that it does not support premium on the app. I’m my opinion if it can’t support it then why put all these premium features? Why not just make it where those are already built in and you don’t have to worry about it but no. Anyways that’s my review.

Not thrilled in the slightest right now. I need my music. Especially because commercials send me to the moon. Why I pay for premium so I don't have to worry about commercials and I can choose the song or genre I would like to listen to. I am super confused and just want my problem resolved.

Vulnerability is beautiful and not for the faint of heart even though at all times completely accessible and a choice available to all. Funs sellable- the journey isn’t a destination.. meaning even though free and available to all- don’t sell the stage to embrace the opportunity to join the show but as a collaborative partner only if invited.

Every time I see an update for this app in the App Store I get excited that it’s myriad issues will finally be resolved and every time I’m let down. The app is so unstable. When the ads try to come up half the time the app just stops. Or the buttons stop working. Or the song looks like it’s playing, buy no sound. Or literally ceases functioning. Sometimes I have to reboot my phone to zap it back to life. I’ve had this app for over a year now and it seems more unstable then ever. How can this be? How can a software company with this much money and this much ‘cool’ be so terrible at software design for iPhones. I just don’t get it. On top of that they want me to pay them monthly to upgrade to premium! No way. I feel bad for their advertisers that are paying them to have their ads not get played b/c the app constantly craps the bed. I only write this b/c I believe these messages can lead to better design.

I only have two small issues though, I think a re existing feature should be added back to where on an artists page, it shows songs that feature them, but now that isn’t there and it’s hard to find songs that feature them. Also when you add songs to que, the very first or very last would be blanked out to the point where you can’t see the song and and sometimes I would move songs up or down the playing next section and it would sometimes glitch out and sometimes when it does that, it crashes the app and resets everything I did with que and playing next.

Spotify,2020-04-02 18:47:44,Steadily Worse,5,"This app is easy to navigate and good for making your own playlists, but in terms of discovering new music, this app does not know what’s up, and seems committed to getting worse and worse.  Every time it updates you will experience confusion, frustration, and eventually regret. There is no customizability to their “radio” function, and they are frequently so off the mark with their recommendations that you wonder if you are even logged into your own account. If it weren’t for the cross fade function they offer, I would have defected back to Pandora a long time ago. Still, I have gotten good use out of this app as long as I am willing to put effort into it like a part time job.

Spotify,2019-08-30 14:11:12,This needs to be changed,5,"So I've been using the app for a few years now and beforehand you could go into anyone of your daily mix playlists, pick a song, and the playlist would continue in the same order it was laid out. But as of this new update if you pick a song, the next song isn't the one that came after the first song you picked. Instead the next song is randomly picking, almost like the playlist is being shuffled. I know that this might not be a problem to some, but this really bugs me because sometimes in a playlist my favorite songs might be back to back to back. But when I finish listening to one I have to wait for the UI to shuffle through every other song in the playlist before I can listen to my favorites.

It is a good app, but this has been upsetting me for way too long now and I searched up how to fix the problems and like I said before, it didn’t work and I can’t ask the app or report a problem.",ᐯIᐯᔕ

Practically every time I leave the app open and try to come back to it -- even within the refresh rate window -- it freezes and I have to force reset it. But that's not the kicker; the kicker is that the app is too stupid to realize it's closed so it starts playing the music it wouldn't let you play before you tried to shut it down. I am consistently frustrated by how ridiculous this thing is. Practically every major developer we rely on at this point just keeps cramming features in without optimizing anything, and while there's been some effort on Spotify's part to make it serious, it still handles like a crappy little plaything on a toy of an operating system. Oh yeah and I'd like it if I could keep my music forever please? And not have to wait for the New Depression to lose it when this company finally runs out of finance capital?",Luxe52
Spotify,2018-02-02 11:00:39,A disaster for slow connection and airplane mode users.,2,"I live in a poor cell signal area and therefore use this app a bit differently. When starting the app up with cellular on, it takes 30-60 sec for it to bring up my music (i.e an age and a half). If I forget to engage airplane mode before starting, I have to quit the app, engage it, and restart, which also takes a bit of time but is much faster than waiting. If the app loads all my music data from local storage in airplane mode anyway, I don’t understand why it cannot just do the same when on cellular and THEN wait for network updates, instead of keeping me waiting for the network updates while forcing me to stare at an empty screen. That’s just bad design. 

Now, because I pretty much have to use it with airplane mode (AM) due to silliness described above, I’ve run into a few things that just don’t work with AM engaged. Sometimes it simply refuses to play music (of course I’m talking about pre-downloaded tracks) and hangs there. This forces me to restart it, sometimes multiple times, until it decides to play again. Then the lock screen mini player will not show track progress, and the little dot stays at 0:00 throughout playback. At times when the progress is shown, it is nigh impossible to grab the little scrubber and drag it to the desired track time. 

Do you guys not use your own products?!

Lastly, there is never any update notes. Sorry, but no notes, no star; it is as simple as that.",Nuka Kola
Spotify,2020-01-23 18:03:20,Great,5,"I love this app and almost everything about it. I can only say that one change that would be greatly appreciated is having your artists and genres in a tab to click on. Say, if I want to shuffle all of my pop music, all I would have to do is click the genres tab, find pop and hit shuffle. Or if I wanted to shuffle songs by an artist in my library, then I could hit artists, and shuffle by artist. Right now the only way to do this is to create a playlist, and I don’t have the time...over all, great app, and highly recommend

Also, another thing I’d like to add is that I hate the new addition of album thumbnails in playlist view. I liked the sharp, clean look of just the song title. When you have the picture of the album next to the song title, it looks cheap and stupid. Just change back the UI to not show the album covers.",XIIE3

I’ve sat through countless train rides with this app on and my ear buds in. The app does have ads if you’re not using premium, but this is to be expected considering every company has to make money somehow. Even though paying for premium may sound like a pain, this method is vastly more cost-efficient than the alternative of paying for every album you want to listen to (apple music.) the app has a very simple and easy to use UI as well as having a system where you can download specific songs to listen to them without using wifi, making it very useful in almost any situation.

However there are some small things that can be made for the convenience of the user. For example, providing the lyrics to every song by just tapping on the song’s album photo. There should also be an option for the user to request song lyrics if it is currently unavailable. Secondly, any song should be made deleted easier from a playlist. At the moment I am able to add any song to a playlist when the song’s album cover is shown on screen, but there is no option to delete it from this place.

Removing the hearts next to songs made it so I can’t see at a glance which songs in an album or playlist I’ve liked before. Local files (which I use a lot) are broken now; I can’t add them to playlists at all, like the option has just been removed??? And the new homepage is downright awful. If you want to copy TikTok and add a stories section somewhere, that’s fine. But removing the entire main interface to do so?? What were you thinking? Recently Playing is gone, which I used all the time. I can’t see more than one album/playlist on my screen at a time because everything has to be a stupid “story” that takes up the entire screen. And the real sin is that they play music that I don’t want to listen to, that I didn’t click on, OUT LOUD without asking. The AI DJ is cool, but it’s overshadowed by the other atrocious decisions made in these last few updates. I’m actually considering switching to Apple Music if none of this gets fixed.",Vinnyeo

Freedom to create my own playlist plus join the great playlists already out there . So if I have a gathering or going camping or having a toad trip.

Another thing is when you pick a song for the radio it does not play songs related to the song you chose. The biggest thing about the app is the ui. I think the stupidest thing is that you can not recover a song you just mistakenly removed from your songs, and how easily it is to remove a song from just a swipe. Sometimes I accidentally remove song from my library and I have no idea what it is. There should be a way we can recover and find out what song you just recently removed. Or another solution would be giving you a confirmation screen if you really want to remove a song from your library.

I took a star off for each of my major issues though. 
     At first it was great. Very very minimal commercials, and I could play anything I wanted. This was on a chrome book. I do not have premium but I could control where I was in the song and could play any song fully.  Then I downloaded it on my phone. The commercials suddenly tripled, and I couldn’t control what song I played nor could I skip parts. This was not a huge inconvenience but still irritating. 

      Next I have my huge problem. I made my playlist and it keeps playing songs I have not added. I look through what it has and it has a “we added” section. I do not like a good majority of these songs and there is no way for them not to play or to skip them without running out of skips. I want to listen to MY music.  This is also such a huge problem because I mainly listen when I am relaxing in a bath or showering. I try to relax in a bath and it plays a song not on my playlist I don’t like I have to sit up, skip it, and try to get back comfortable. If I am showering o can’t skip it and Siri doesn’t listen so I have to listen to it. This really is the main reason I gave 3 stars, as this pesters me SO MUCH.

1. the crashing. the apps seems to crash quite often. i’ll be listening to a song and then bam the app crushes and i have to go back to the app and play the song again but it’ll restart it which is very VERY annoying. and that doesn’t even fix the problem. it’ll happen over and over again (even closing out the app doesn’t help). it’s so so annoying and irritating because i just want to listen to my music smoothly and even a simple music app can’t do that. 

2. the shuffle. a good chunk of my playlists are fairly short (about 15-30 songs) i play them all on shuffle and because my playlists are short they end fairly quick. but whenever i go back to shuffle and play my playlist again it won’t change the shuffle list. it’ll play the songs in the same order again. which... defeats the whole purpose of shuffle and is quick upsetting when you want to listen to a completely new order of your songs. 

but overall this app is very very good! just those two cons make me rate it 4 stars because they are quick annoying and shouldn’t even be a problem with an amazing app like this!",redrxsy
Spotify,2021-07-03 17:12:10,Plz fix the adds on JRE,5,This is my favorite app for music/ podcasts.  I’m fine listening to ads (even though I shouldn’t because I’m paying for a premium membership) but unfortunately once the ads start on the JRE podcast they literally don’t stop. I’ve tested this out and At some point I’ll just give up.  I’ll just shut the app down and go back to the podcast to find my place and just skip over the ad break.  However it’s very frustrating to do this while driving or exercising. I’m not sure if other people are having this problem with this specific podcast but it’s really irritating to deal with when you’re driving and all of a sudden your podcast is now playing like 10 minutes of ads…. It will NOT go back to the podcast after the ad breaks. Thanks  😎,Dani.Tea
Spotify,2023-03-22 22:55:54,Stop changing the UI so much,4,"Edit: they fixed my issue by changing the behavior of the checkmark button, but these UI changes have just been nonstop lately. I’m fine with an improved experience, IF it improves the experience. 

This new method of “liking songs” is awful. 1) you can’t see what songs you have saved to your liked songs in a playlist anymore 2) adding songs to your liked playlist takes longer now (additional menu) 3) in car view, saving a song is now more dangerous because of the additional menu It really is not that hard to just make a “heart” button and a “playlist” button on the same screen. These buttons serve different purposes. Bring back the old method, this new one is garbage and I really hoped the developers would’ve realized it sucked when they were beta testing it.",ItsNotColton
Spotify,2023-01-01 14:20:15,Great app But.,2,"I like being a premium because with it you get add free music and you can listen to any song you want to. No matter what  kind you like. You can go from Rock to Oldies to classical. Or my sister loveEngelbert   Humperdinck. I know I spelled that wrong. But I think most people know who I’m talking about. Or the Brady Bunch Christmas album. The bad part is I have it on my iPad. I couldn’t pay one month because I had some big expenses thst month. I  have been batting Cancer for six years now. I went to see my doctor and found out it’s  stronger and has spread more . So I’m kinda bedridden. I can walk around my house. To use the restroom and the kitchen to get foos . But I have trouble walking out of my house. Iypts not fear, it my back and knees. I am not asking for anything. I don’t need money. I ask for prayers, nothing  more.  The problem is I went to free . I want to go back to premium? But I can’t using the app?  How do I get the premium that’s $9.99.?  If anyone can help me, I would be thankful..",Mike bis
Spotify,2021-09-30 00:17:43,The only app I’ve been using for music since 2015,4,Has every song I’ve ever wanted to listen to. The “radio” feature is great for discovering new music. Things that could be better - it seems that the “radio” feature tends to favor artists’ hits and there’s less popular songs from an artist won’t come up unless you go to the artist page and listen to all songs from the artist. Also I don’t like using shuffle in listening to my library of liked songs bc it will overly favor some songs and rarely ever play others. I’ve had to unlike some songs just so that they would stop coming up so often when using shuffle. I have 1405 songs on my list. I’ll instead just scroll to a random song on the liked songs list and play them in sequential order to get more diversity of songs (vs hearing the same ones too often).,Ab1223445
Spotify,2021-01-04 01:22:14,I love it!!! But a few changes.,5,"It’s so good!! First, you don’t have to do pay about like what? 14$ a month. Second, off it has nice audio. Third off there’s are some things I would like to change it’s that please stop adding on songs that people don’t want to hear just keep the songs that the real person put. It would be really helpful. Also, I would like it if you did let the person who skips A song you should let the person go back if they accidentally missed clicked. Also, l would love it if you gave people more skips because I have to wait 6 whole hours. It’s annoying please fix that also can we have 10 skips. Also please let people change their icons whenever they want. Otherwise, it’s a good app. I hope you can fix the changes that I requested! Thank you if you are getting this message/ review",Jaypeeez
Spotify,2021-04-04 12:36:06,Just one thought.,4,"My last review was a complaint about how you guys repeat the same ads over and over, and you fixed it. Mostly. Thank you; that was considerate. 

What I would like to bring to your attention this time is that when you make promises, you have to keep them. This issue is beginning to happen with the “watch this video to get thirty minutes of add-free music!...(yes, really!)” 

So I click on the add, watch the add, sometimes even enjoy the add...and then six minutes later I’m getting the same thing. I don’t know if it’s a glitch or not, but it may become a problem if it is happening with more than just me. If you tell people that they can get thirty add-free minutes of music if they do something, and then they DO that stuff, and you don’t give them the 30 minutes...it’s like shorting someone on a payment. Nobody likes that.",annoyed.anon.
Spotify,2021-02-05 16:12:39,Shockingly bad app,1,"I love this service and have used this app for years, but this app runs so badly that I am starting to consider swapping to Apple Music. The download music function is a joke. Music that I have had downloaded for months will randomly not be available whenever I leave service. Entire playlists will decide they need to re-download on a whim. It is impossible to access downloaded albums without service, it will just attempt to load indefinitely. The only way to actually have radios download is to open the app and go to the radio everyday after they update (sometimes they never update at all!). Another great feature is how the app will randomly close itself mid-song, this is awesome whenever you’re in the middle of an activity and have to stop to reopen the app. The crashing has been much worse than ever for the last 2 updates. 
I’ve been putting up with the quirks of this app for years but now I’m wondering why I’m paying $10 a month for an app that I constantly have issues with.",111111111111111111111111----1
Spotify,2020-10-20 00:25:36,Only a couple problems,5,"Like the app. It’s pretty straightforward and makes it easier to find new music. I’ve had problems with it glitching or something lately though. When I tried to play my liked songs it started playing random music. I checked and it was because none of my liked songs were there anymore. The songs were still liked when I looked them up but I had to relike them to put them back in the liked album. Problem is, I don’t know the names of most of the songs I had in there. Kind of inconvenient. 
The second problem is that whenever I watch the ad for 30 minutes of free listening, it never gives me more than 4-6 songs before it starts playing a series of ads. It’s a little bit annoying so I hope it’s fixed soon.",FarmGirl7003

Spotify,2020-11-10 07:23:41,Progressively worse,1,"About a year ago there was an update that made it so to search your library for a specific artist you had to be following them like this is discount Twitter. Annoying but fine, I’ll just follow my artists and then I can still search my library for a specific one and play them when I want. Now that’s not even possible. Searching YOUR LIBRARY for an artists will show you that artists ENTIRE catalog, regardless of how many of those songs you’ve actually saved. Why even have an artists tab in your library if that tab takes you to music that isn’t in your library? The artists tab takes you to the same place that a regular search takes you. If the goal was to “streamline” the app then you just made two routes to the same destination, while removing a vital feature.
Now, if you turn off data and click on the artist you’re given a “downloaded songs” option. Was it really too difficult to give this option when data is turned on as well? Why do I have to cripple my phone to make the app usable?",Faint366
Spotify,2022-01-30 03:46:21,My reason to keep going on.,5,"This app has been here sitting on my phone for some years now. It has helped me through many steps in my life wether it be marriage, divorce, work, unemployment, etc. and if it weren’t for this app then I don’t know how I would make it through it. It has helped introduce me to a plethora of different artists that I have come to love and see grow in their careers. It has been so easy and compatible to use and rely on when you have your turn to play music with friends or even for yourself. The option to have music offline is also a blessing as it has given me the ability to keep my music even when I am for example camping or far away in the sticks. Overall this app is a phenomenal treasure and I wish I could give it a better score than 5 stars!!",Chrismyster1
Spotify,2019-03-31 11:36:47,Can’t restart playlist,2,"So, the app is great, yeah. Good music, doesn’t drain my battery like some other music apps. However, the user interface is pretty bad, meaning you can’t restart your playlist. Once it’s done with your songs, it plays some recommended songs, aka songs that aren’t in my playlist, aka songs I don’t want to listen to. I know some people appreciate this feature, but not me. I only want to listen to the songs in my playlist and nothing but, however there is no way I can restart my playlist. I’ve googled it and everything to no avail. I’ve seen people say “there is no easy way to restart your playlist” but I can’t find any way whatsoever. Please, just please change this so I don’t have to use some other bad app that crashes every three songs. Also, what’s the point of shuffling when it plays your songs in the same order anyway? Yeah, it plays it in a random order, but it’s that same random order every time. Mix it up! Overall, good as an app, good idea, bad execution.",yoshihitoismydad
Spotify,2021-12-31 20:48:19,Almost perfect,5,"Spotify’s almost perfect, but I feel like the fact that there are so many things that are added in the premium that you’re missing in the free version is kind of crazy. (Though it does make people want to buy it more so credit to them on that.) Also, I think the algorithm that shows songs that are similar to each other could be improved, because I end up seeing songs that I’ve already heard or know, and I think it would be better if it showed songs that are similar, but that I have not heard. (So that there’s not so many repeats, especially in the daily mixes. Usually it’s things I’ve already liked or listened to multiple times. Which can be good or bad.)

Overall, it’s a great app I just think there could be some improvements.",Pepper Onella
Spotify,2020-02-23 21:28:53,Not bad but not good,5,The quality on my music is real good with my headphones my music sounds even better but what makes this app from keeping it from being perfect is the inclusion of limited skips witch makes this app makes me run out of skips before I get to the song I wanna get what I recommend for this app is to just let us listen to the song we want to listen to with out making us lose all our skips. Plus the inclusion of a premium hurt this app a bit the premium gives you unlimited skips and the ability to download songs but what I don’t understand is why I can not Download music from the beginning. Overall this music app is. It perfect but not bad if you want quality  music this is the app but warned you we’ll have to skip a lot to get the song you want.,link15ink
Spotify,2021-12-13 23:09:14,Mostly Good,4,"Everything about the app is amazing, I am listing to it right now actually. My playlist has over 100 songs on it, and I can find most of the songs I want to add to it. There are also clean versions of most songs that have foul language. Also, they have added lyrics now that moves with the song, which is amazing as well! But the is one thing that is sooo annoying There are SO MUCH adds. And like I said it’s really annoying. Example, right now I have been listing to music for about 30 minutes straight, and there has been AT LEAST 13 adds. Probably over. I’m not joking. There isn’t even an option to skip it! (I think. If I’m wrong very sorry) So that is one suggestion I have for the app, is that there is a skip option on the adds. Then it wouldn’t be as bad. Otherwise, the app is great, I love it! Thanks for your time! 😁",Emma Veliz
Spotify,2021-06-24 03:56:30,Encouraging bait,4,"The music selection is good and there are some concepts that are good but there are some major issues with it that I cannot respect.

The immense amount of ads that play one after another are absolutely baffling, just now I got 5 straight, 30 second, unskippable ads. This alongside things like not being able to directly chose what song you want to listen to, instead having to shuffle a playlist; or the 6 skips per hour rule, really only have one purpose. There is no rational reason why these limitations would be put in place other than to siphon money out of its users that want to listen to their favorite artists. It’s scummy and it’s not even trying to hide it, they are essentially saying, “Yeah you can try and bare with these restrictions we set in place, OR you could pay us money to get rid of the issues we made.”",LukewarmThursday
Spotify,2018-02-12 03:18:40,Could have some improvements,5,"I’ve been using this app for a few years and I loved it until recently. I hate making a playlist and not even hearing any of the music on it. I, personally, love musicals and try to listen to my favorites but I can’t. I don’t want to hear music from rappers when I’m listening to the music I was hoping I could hear. Also, I don’t appreciate getting false advertisement. I can’t be told to listen to an ad and get 30 minutes of ad-free music but have to sit through 5 ads, listen to three songs and get another 4 ads. I would really love to see a listen history. I don’t have premium and I usually leave my music playing off my speaker and phone when I leave the room so if I come back at the end of the song, and I like it, I want to be able to come back and find the song.",Kim.m.1868
Spotify,2021-02-24 10:31:47,Just stop this,1,"Honestly, i dont know where to start, i just cant out it out, how bad this issue is, this review is for people who cant have premium, why must i have to listen to songs ALWAYS in shuffle, it just screws up the music taste, if it were to be in order, they could section off the music in their playlist, speaking of playing music, why must i have to wait so long to play songs? The most ads i have ever had was 7! Seriously?! In my last review i talked over this, but its apparent you never read them, but in case you do, i will write this! Another thing bad about the ad problem, why must i wait 30 seconds to skip an ad, only to get a whole bunch more! This is just picking on the people who wont give you money! This is so wrong and there needs to be a change to this, you gave us the opposite of what we asked for, we asked for less ads and you gave us more. To add on, why do you add on more songs we never knew of or never inew the genre of? Just let us listen to the songs WE WANT TO. Honestly, this is supposed to be a music app, total shame!",Tacos201
Spotify,2021-02-12 21:41:11,This won’t make a difference but..,2,"Premium user and have been one for years now...so if I’m paying monthly for this app, why are there ads in the middle of podcasts that already do ads for their shows? What’s the point of paying premium if I still have to listen to unwanted ads? That’s the main point of paying premium. 

(I’m not sure about androids) but on iPhone why is it that I have no choice but to stream video from a podcast unless I download/turn off option for video first? If I stream a podcast without downloading it, I have no choice but to play the video as well. I understand it’s a new feature for this app, but navigating podcasts on this app is just redundant and frustrating. Give us a quick scroll! 

Same for the music! Quick scroll! And why did you take the “songs” tab away? The new update just booted a lot of discovered artists I’ll probably never find again now that it requires you to “follow” each one. Why are we trying to treat this like a one stop social media/streaming platform? Why does it take me to the artists profile whenever I tap on them in my “artists” section? Extremely redundant.
 
Then to top it all off I had a couple of albums downloaded and then a few weeks later they’re just gone? The songs that made it into my “on repeat” stayed downloaded, but the whole albums are just gone without putting in any input. I could go on and on..

But it's kinda irritating me, my brother won't hook me up to the family premium because it's to time consuming and takes a long time. Why do I have to go through an hour of my time just to put me on premium? It's also pretty annoying when I only have 6 skips per hour, what's the point of that?  And I just want to play one song, that's it but I have to listen to a whole nother album of songs I don't know. It makes me so frustrated. And I have this bug where I'll be listening to a song and it randomly closes out of the app completely. The adds are also out of hand. Why do I have to watch a ""short"" video to get only 40 minutes of uninterrupted listening? It's only a 5 star if you had premium. I'm just getting super annoyed with this app. I honestly have nothing good to say about it unless I had premium.

So, as I just mentioned, I am a teenager, so I don’t actually have a computer. This is a problem because I would like to make my playlists look more appealing to me, and the main way I would like to do that is by adding my own picture to the cover of my playlists. It wouldnt be that hard to incorporate an option to change the playlist cover into the editing lauyout, so why hasnt it been done yet? I understand that the change would have to be coded in and i understand that that is a task, but the design element of it isn’t so hard that it just cant be a part of the app. There is already an option to do this on desktop and its just confusing that it hasn’t been done on mobile.

It makes me watch 7 videos then plays 2 songs and then right back to ads. If you would stick to what you advertise and give us an actual 30 mins of ad free music, your product would be worthwhile. And why are the ads a lot louder than the music? I listen to music when I’m working and play it over a loud speaker, I turn my speaker all the way up to hear it. When the ads come on I have to turn it down cause it’s way too loud then have to turn it back up when the music comes on. Kind of a waste of my time If you ask me. And sometimes when a song plays, about halfway through it skips itself and plays another song. Or when I’m listening to one artist, it plays another that has nothing to do with what I was listening to. I listen to country and heavy metal.

I mean I got unlimited but I can afford it, uh, I don’t know if other people can so that was for the people out there 😃. I love country music and some pop but most pop songs now are, for example, Kiki. Or, anything by Drake, XXX, or Tydollasign or The weekend are NAUGHTY. I know some people may not agree with me like this, but you should put a thing where you can see the peoples playlist, and give the people who dont like XXX, Or drake, or anything else, a mute button to mute out the bad songs. I’m ok with like 5 swear words in a song, but really bad songs mute out. Songs with rap in them are fine but ones with bad bad words and songs that rap through the hole song, actually, TALK through the whole song SHOULD BE MUTED.

So every now and then my music will magically just pause and stay paused until I unpause it, and my app is fully updated so don’t know how to fix it.  Also every now and then my app will just close and I’ll have to log back on and start again.  Another this is the skips, I know you want to promote premium by only giving 6 skips but I think that everyone’s got sick of 6 skips and personally think we need more like 10.  One more not really problem but confusion is that I’d like to see the prices of premium on the app, unless I’m just dumb but I don’t see options to buy premium on the app let alone see the prices. But still love the app just needs some little tweaks!",GradyH👍
Spotify,2022-12-27 17:37:57,I don't like the new changes.,3,I miss the old update. I used to be able to click on the song and it would play a sample of it. Now I would have to hear the whole song which is time consuming when I am just trying to make playlists. I also noticed when adding songs from my liked lists it does not tell me if i added that song already to one of my playlists so it makes me forget what new song I discovered that needs to be sorted into a playlists of mine. Please allow us to be able to still listen to samples of a song in a playlist instead of forcing us to listen to the entire playlist just to figure out if that one song is the one we want. And please bring back the update that showed us if our liked songs are in certain playlists of ours already. Thank you!

Spotify,2022-08-07 21:27:39,Forcing Music,1,"I have been using the free version for years now, but recently the app has continuously tried to force music, well outside of my normal genres upon me.
I have noticed more and more commercials, even more than listening to the radio, but I’m willing to endure it for the ability to hear MY playlist.
I understand that after running through my playlist, I will hear music based upon my selections in my playlist, but I have well over 300 songs in my playlist and for the past few months I am having to close my playlist, open a new one and then returning to my original playlist, after just a few songs. I have to do this every 4-5 songs!!
I’ve already begun using other music streaming apps and will likely be deleting this app because of it.
I would be okay with it occasionally throwing in new music within my preferred genres but that’s NOT what it is doing. I’m a metal fan and throwing in pop music or country, which is nowhere in any of my playlist is completely insane",TR-EasyPrey
Spotify,2022-01-19 19:32:34,"App is good, heads up for free users",3,"As mentioned, the app is good. Semi wonderful interface and easy to use. However, there are some questionable choices to get you to use premium. You aren’t allowed to fully play specific songs in your playlist, and you are only allowed 6 song skips an hour. This is a pain for me since my song playlists are long the only way to hear the specific song I want is to shuffle enough times to hope it’ll run. If I search the song up, it will find a playlist with the song in it. Not, the actual song I want to listen to. Again, the app itself is good and there’s lots of music choices to choose from. But as someone who sometimes wants to listen to a specific song and have long playlists, this can be and is easily a pain to deal with. I don’t believe anyone should have to pay to find something they could find for free elsewhere",xTwinky

I also love the yearly wraps, like looking back to see what I listened to and also to see how much was epic! Like 63,000 minutes this year, and it’ll be more next year believe me.

 However, if in a different update, could it be possible to have a checklist for your playlists you add to?? It’s just a hassle to have to click “Add to playlist” 3-5 times depending on where I want a song. It’s perfect how it is right now, but that would be nice. And also having the volume bar be to the side or top would be nice unless I guess with the new update for iPhone at least the volume is on the side, but something like Instagram or YouTube’s volume bar just being very minimal would be pretty cool.",dragonator777

I don’t usually use playlists honestly, I usually click the recently played artists I have down under the home tab and shuffle the music I save for that specific artist.  However, this update made that feature disappear as now when I click on any artists I follow it brings me to their main account page where the only way I can see my saved songs is by going to their various albums.  I don’t know why someone thought that was a good idea, as it’s really completely annoying and makes it so much more difficult to see the songs I saved for specific artists (by the way this is for mobile).  Please change it back to how it was, or at least make it an option to do so because the new UI is creating tons of inconveniences and complications.",DisturbedPig98
Spotify,2019-07-08 23:30:41,"For me, no music streaming service stands out.",3,"I think the most disappoint thing about this app, and any music streaming service, is the algorithm it uses to suggest music to you. From what I can tell, there’s no way to modify your preferences when creating stations or having it suggest music. For example, one my favorite artists have been making music for a while now, and their sound as changes a lot since they started. So, I might create a station with music that they put out on their new album, and then the station starts playing music similar to what they made in 2005. It’s disheartening when you are looking for new music similar to what an older artist is creating today. It would be refreshing to have the ability to narrow the algorithm to specific timeframes and remove artists or genres you don’t want to listen to.  Like for real, Sum 41’s new music is mostly medallic hardcore and metal and it’s playing Good Charlotte and The Offspring for crying out loud.",Walalalalalalalalololo

I like to download new full albums and playlists before a long trip so I can listen to them all during the ride but it’s tedious to have to scroll through the entire album and playlist lists just to find the ones that I downloaded.  It would be a lot easier to just have the downloaded folder back so I can see all the ones I had downloaded in one place.

Also, it would be nice to have that right swipe delete feature when it comes to editing playlists.

Spotify,2018-05-31 11:04:23,Sure,4,"I don’t think the user interface is the most intuitive. (Since when does “liking” or “hearting” something grant you access to it?) The “shuffle” ain’t random, either. (Listen to a 150+ song playlist on two different days and the first five songs play in the exact same order each time?) Their algorithm could use some work. Like radio stations, I assume they only have rights to play content in accordance with the specific buyer-distributor agreement for the content, but Jaysus. The ads are disorienting, too, but that’s not something I can really fault them for. They gotta make money somehow, or they can’t pay artists. (I just hope they’re not ripping artists off. I hope they pay what they genuinely think is fair for the content and not just the cheapest offer they can get away with.)

Spotify,2022-08-13 15:26:25,One awful glitch (It's fixed now!),5,"One of the recent updates must’ve broken the radio feature on songs, albums, and playlists. They do work almost as intended if you open a radio and play it on shuffle (which *will* play random songs on shuffle, but *won’t* even play the songs shown on the list?), but if you select one of the songs manually, it won’t play and the buttons for switching over to the previous/next song will be greyed out. Other times, clicking on songs or trying to play the radio just won’t do anything. Songs featured on radios sometimes get switched out or shuffled, too. It’s an all around bad time. I was hoping that the update pushed today would fix it, but no dice.

The quality is amazing and the selection of music is wonderful. However one thing that would make it so much better is if we could arrange songs in our liked songs the same way you can arrange them in playlists. It is really a drag that you can’t drag and move songs in order as you like in your liked songs, which is really the only “playlist” I, and probably many others listen to. It would be a really useful addition, and a simple one too that would make the app much better. Other than that, great app, and i definitely prefer over any others.",Isaac Mateo

Spotify,2019-09-19 14:35:46,“Shuffle” is broken,4,"I’ve never been too bothered by adds or the lack of premium, and the app is still great to use, but there has been a problem over the last couple of days. 
Lately I’ve been obsessed over one of my favorite albums from a great creator, and I’ve been putting the one album on shuffle. The problem is, it’s started to lay songs that have nothing to do with either the artist nor the album itself. I’m getting really irritated  since even shuffling artists, playlists, and albums of other kinds are starting to play and rotate songs that aren’t even a part of and/or related to that playlist, album, or artist.
Please please PLEASE can this get fixed? I really hope this is just some glitch, because I don’t care how many adds I have to see a day without premium, as long as I can actually SHUFFLE. WHAT. I. LIKE.

Bot my taste at all and I’ve tried to turn it off but I can’t. Not without premium. I’m mainly frustrated because of this reason. Otherwise it’s like a 7/10 for me. I like YTM better because you can listen to ur music in order, make playlists without all these crap songs in the middle, and they have a bigger library of small creators and remixes. The one thing abt YTM is the adds and that’s it. I just want to listen to the music that I PUT in my playlist and not all these songs in the middle.

In my IPad on the other hand; it lets me play any song and lets me skip as many times as I want (and I don’t have premium). On my phone it’s the complete opposite. That’s really annoying. I don’t get why being able to play any song in a playlist or album is a premium feature. If I’m trying to choose a certain song from a playlist or album; I can’t because it won’t let me see the songs. If it does (which is rare), it only lets me see a preview of the song or piece. I feel like some of the non-premium features are just unfair. It’s hard when you’re trying to listen to a piece you like but you can’t because without premium you can’t choose certain songs.

Another problem along with that is I’m not able to skip throughout the song??? How does that makes sense? Say you want your friend to hear a specific part of a song, so why have to hear the whole song when you just want to hear that one part?

After this I will go to another playlist and then return to the first one but the song is still playing so I can’t use the playlist. Can you loop songs instead of shuffling them?

Now it only plays the same tracks on repeat no matter what I was listening to before. It’s frustrating how similar the playback is too, it’s playing an almost identical set every time, not even songs I would usually listen to.

The app adds songs to your playlist and you don’t have the option to turn that off. Only getting 7 skips an hour is stupid because I shouldn’t have to listen to a song I don’t want to listen to on my own playlist. The ads. Sometimes I have to listen to 3 30 second ads.

It’s literally unbelievable how many ads there are now. I hate this app now. There used to be a set algorithm where you got so and so amount of skips (6) and 30 minutes of ad-free music. Now they changed their algorithm so it’s different depending on what playlist you’re listening to. I just listened to 1 song after listening to a FEW MINUTES of ads and then skipped like 5 songs bc I didn’t like the playlist I had going and I had to listen to MORE ADS. When those were done I changed the playlist to my liked songs and I GOT MORE ADS FOR “30 minutes of uninterrupted listening”- that’s a rarity now. Lately they’ve been giving ads with no guaranteed amount of time after it that you get ad-free listening. 

There are a lot of good things but right now I can’t see past all the ads I’m being bombarded with. I’ve literally gotten to the point where I expect ads to play next before I expect music to play.",anschnitz

Here is my suggestion:
You should actually give us 30 minutes of “uninterrupted music” when you say you will. I got that add, then it made me watch a video, then played one song. Then it did it after that. Song. That is a straight up lie. I don’t know if those ads are randomized or not. If they are, can you make it how it waits 30 minutes until playing that ad and any other ad please?

Spotify,2022-06-17 18:54:01,Make the free plan have more features!!!,3,"So I would’ve gave this app a five if it wasn’t for the very limited features with the free plan, this app is great but the problem I have is that with the free plan if I go to my playlist I can’t just have the list of my songs I have to go into the shuffle and I only have 6 skips an hour so if in the six times I skip I don’t get the song I wait I ether will have to wait for an in predictable amount of time or I have to wait an hour til I get more skips. So the weird thing is that on my iPad this does not happen but on my phone it does so I don’t know what is up with that. So all I ask is that you either make the free plan have more features like being able to freely play any song in a playlist without having to go in shuffle, or you can give us unlimited skips. Thank you for reading this I would really appreciate you doing this.”",Pitckey27
Spotify,2022-03-29 18:43:10,Could be better,3,"Songs pause for no reason. Downloaded songs won’t play away from wi-fi, parts of playlists or albums are greyed out, even when I hit the “downloaded” tab in my library. The songs reappear when I am near wi-fi again but this defeats the purpose. Reinstalling the app will fix for a few weeks then it will start again. Offline songs were the whole reason I went premium. If you make a playlist while you’re offline it will work great, even works for a few hours when you are around wi-fi again, then it will delete the playlist, even if you’re in the middle of playing said playlist. I contacted tech on this one and they said you technically can’t make playlists offline, and that it was strange it would even let me create one at all (it let me do everything but edit the playlist picture).

First of all sometimes while I’m listening to a podcast I will want to go back while listening on my headphones so I take my phone out and hit the skip back 15 seconds . But sometimes it takes me back to a totally different time that could be 10 mins back or an hour back! I and don’t see where I was because I didn’t expect it to do that. Sometimes I will change to a whole other episode. Something with the skip forward button. Second, when I click on an episode I wanna hear sometimes it will start a totally different episode at random and won’t let me change. No matter how many times I close and open the app. And finally I don’t wanna have to manually skip an ad from a podcast with the time scroller!! There isn’t even a button to hit skip! I have to manually drag the time scroller even tho I pay for premium!! Makes 0 sense.",Zca_Scarface

Adding onto that, I don’t like how it only allows 6 skips per hour, because after I skip through the songs the add on I have no skips left. They also make it so you can’t skip back to a song. Sometimes I press skip by accident and then I can’t go back. Also, they say watch this video for 30 minutes of uninterrupted music. It’s more like 20 for me. Also, the adds are constantly the same thing, even after I’ve put a bad review on them. One last thing. I don’t know if this is my phone itself or it is the app, but after about an hour of music it randomly stops playing.

Before, once in the playlist, you could swipe down and it would populate a search bar at the top. That is no longer there. The search function is now at the top of the “Your Library” tab and it states you can search anything you have “liked, followed or created” but you can only search playlist title names. It will not populate a specific song within in a playlist. I would like to see this changed back or fixed. Other than that, I have been using this app for 12+ years and it continues to get better.

The only 2 problems I have is the recommended songs I listen to my playlist and after 5 songs a random song comes on and I have no idea what it is and it’s annoying when I go to sleep with music on. And also some of my downloaded playlists and my liked songs won’t play offline and it’s annoying because your listening to ur playlist like for example me listening to my likes playlist while camping with no service and all the sudden none of my songs are playing except some and so I have to click on another song and some of the songs that aren’t playing that are downloaded are my favorites and it’s very irritating.

My rating is actually a lie, i give this app 3 stars. The reason is because 2 things. 1: There are way to many adds, and it gets annoying when you keep getting them. The second reason is the main reason i am rating this low. When i am listening on my playlist, it play an hour of “recommended songs” that i never listen to. I want to listen to my music, and i would be fine if they played one suggested song per loop, but it is way too much. I am listening on this app right now, and i am in the middle of the 30th+ recommended song. This is way too much!

But when adding your favorite songs it adds different songs for you to listen to, and it gets annoying how you have to literally use all of your six free skips per hour just to get to the song you want. Especially when you have just a few different songs added, and you dont like the songs that was added for you and you dont have a button to delete that song and add a different one. Another one is that when adding the songs you want you can’t listen to the song to make sure its the right song so you have to add it to your playlist first then listen to the song and if its not the right song then you have to remove it and go back to find the correct one.",MMMusicListener

I could play a song on another music app, and it’d play so much better and louder, but on here, you’ve gotta have premium for that like what’s up with that? Not everyone can afford that you know. And the ads get old, especially since they’re literally almost always the same. Especially about the music you guys have like not everyone wants to hear advertisements about pop music ten times per hour. The ads are to repetitive and they need to spaced out more, because after two or three songs, I’ve gotta deal with about 2 minutes of advertisements, it’s just not convenient. One last thing, is your selection for music. It’s decent, but unless you’re a big pop or rap person, it’s not all there.",MechaHorizon
Spotify,2021-08-04 23:12:51,"Incredible App, Only One Issue:",5,"As stated in the title, this app is amazing, superior to other free music apps in almost all ways. My one issue with it is this: 
While listening to music, whether the app is open or running background, the music will inevitably stop after half an hour - an hour. Not only that, but if I go to open the app again, it will reboot, and the song will restart. This in itself would not be a massive issue if it did not instantly repeat as soon as the song was over. This bug prevents me from doing work while listening to music on my phone due to the fact that I need to restart the app completely after each individual song. If this were fixed, the app would be nearly flawless in the large.",Mr. Game Critik
Spotify,2022-01-30 09:10:05,hmm..,3,"okay don’t get me wrong i like this app and it’s so easy to make a playlist and organize but the way this app works is literally so annoying.
If you press an album you want to listen to from an artists profile it will literally play any that’s not on that album unless you skip 8 different times and if you shuffle the artists songs another “recommended artist” will play and whenever you do listen to music you get the same adds after every song and the same thing with podcasts
if you have a playlist with podcasts i between every podcast they play a recommended artist and you would have to open your phone and press play to hear the next one… what’s the point of making a podcast playlist if you have to keep pressing the podcast you want to listen to one after one
anyway this app is generally annoying and not worth the hype",want to be youtuber
Spotify,2017-12-22 18:53:37,Learn to use and it is beautiful,5,"Reading through reviews, many who complain seem to simply be uneducated in how some of the quirks are in this app. Everything that is supposed to work in a certain way does, such as the playlist repeats and such, and where I see people get wound up is in the suggestion/ radio playlists that seemingly “can come on randomly”. As someone who uses this app extensively, that is quite possible the most beautiful feature to me. I have discovered so much beautiful music from new artists big and small that I love. All you have to do is make sure that repeating is on if you don’t want this feature to start when the playlist/album is over, and it’s easy to manage. This is a great app that has allowed me to discover and appreciate all kinds of music, just try it out!",Fun...ish hhhhhhhhhh

It has struggle shuffling songs sometimes and doesn’t play a very good variety with your music, however that’s not the biggest issue. It will say “watch a ad for 30 minutes of ad free music” and if you press not now, you will be able to play your song without an ad but the next song will have an ad. I do this so I can connect the song to my speaker because i listen to music a lot. I will press “not now” and it will play 3-4 ads! It makes no sense and i have to sit there and wait before i can connect. It just plays multiple ads between every 1-2 songs and is outrageous. I get it, you have to have ads in there to make a profit but not that many in a row, for such a small period of time, and when i deliberately press NOT Now.

Spotify,2020-03-17 05:06:07,Awful UI,1,"Why is it so hard to find play songs that I’ve downloaded, if I don’t want to make a playlist?

Why when I go to MY library of artists, do I not see the artists I’ve downloaded albums from? Instead I see useless suggestions, of artists that I’ve played like once before, but the ones I listen to constantly are buried? I don’t want to spend the time configuring the app, by “choose artists” I just want to find who I want to listen to and play their music. 

Why can’t I just see an ALPHABETICAL list of artists? About 90 of the time I listen to stuff, I just have to search for from home, even though it’s in my library buried somewhere. 

Why when I click albums do I see a list of albums, but that’s where you’ve decided to organize the artists alphabetically, leaving the album names themselves look like you’ve ordered the album names by random. 

Why is it that in every album I play, you default it to shuffle, and I have to manually turn it back off, EACH TIME I play the same album. It’s super frustrating. Why can I not just set a global setting of shuffle play = no,  and repeat = no, and have the app remember my preference?

I’ve been a paying customer for quite sometime and the app has to be great. It’s been a steady decline for the last year, and I’ve finally had it and writing this review. 

Come on. I do this crap for a living and it blows my mind that your UI/UX team would let this awful of an app get released in this day and age. 

Please fix it.",jarbear82

If I make a typo(which I so often do) I don’t know I did until the app tells me that it can’t find that song. Sometimes the text appears but after about a few seconds it disappears. Super annoying! You guys are constantly updating this app and every time I think “Okay I’m sure they fixed it this time” but no change! It’s a small bug but it makes a huge difference in user experience.

The monthly free time limited thing is a total piece of crap
I don’t see any reason to do this.   It just makes people want to upgrade to premium! And plus it says “monthly”.
MONTHLY! It just became August and it says You have reached the monthly time limit of 15 hours or something like that. I don’t listen to 15 hours of music in 4 days!
If you’re not going to fix it, or remove this feature,
PLEASE up it to 30 hours, not 15.
Next thing. This doesn’t bother me that much, but I want to mention it. The shuffle feature. Do you guys know what the shuffle feature really is? Cause you guys are doing it wrong!
Get it right! You guys are one of the biggest music apps!
I’ll explain it to from Wikipedia. It says”Shuffle play is a mode of music playback in which songs are played in a randomized order that is decided upon for all tracks at once. It is commonly found on CD players, digital audio players and media player software. Shuffle playback prevents repeated tracks, which makes it distinct from random playback, in which the next track is chosen at random after the last track has ended.” Ok?
Also guys, you should really reply to your customer reviews.
I really wonder if you guys are reading our reviews!
Beside those problems, I really love this app!

When I’m listening to music, I sometimes want to go and listen to a specific part of the song, it may be because I haven’t updated mine yet, but it won’t let me go back into the song. I switched to a different song and went back to the one I was listening to and it is still at the place it was before I switched. But then it got worse. So then I closed the app, and it still was in the same spot as before. So then I decided to listen in Apple Music for the rest of the time. And at the end of the day, it was still at that spot.

But now its not a feature anymore? These are to name a few. The app  very inconsistent with what features they offer.

Spotify,2023-02-11 17:33:54,"Can’t turn off enhance, app glitches",1,"By far my worst performing app. I can’t understand how they won’t let you play downloaded music. I constantly have little to no cell reception and would love to play down loaded music however the new updated version requires you to turn off enhance to even get into said downloaded songs/playlists. The catch is you need cell service to turn off the enhanced setting. Shouldn’t you need the enhanced button to be depressed instead? Why would I want them choosing my music for me unless I say so? This is a terrible oversight. 
  Also every time I open the app it needs to download my saved songs. Why doesn’t it just download it once so I can access them like the old days lol. I don’t understand how all the increases in technology further make it more difficult to simply listen to music. Do I have to go back to cd’s to enjoy music?

It seems like the timer function doesn’t appear for many people in the mobile app. Also hate how it’s harder to delete songs from a playlist. You have to click on edit the playlist and then search through the list to remove individual songs but it would be better if you could remove as you listen or swipe right to remove. Swipe right is currently for adding to liked songs but that is not necessary since there is the heart right next to the song you can click.

They end up playing several commercials, which I suffer through, and then play 1 song, ONE SONG! Before playing 5 more commercials! So if I’m busy or in the shower, or cooking, just otherwise unable to shut the app down, I have to sit here and listen to more commercials! I know I can buy the premium, and that’s what they’re trying to trick me into, but corona has taken my money away, and now I don’t have extra for frivolous things.

Simple things like importing photos into your playlist covers on a mobile device, checking what’s playing when on the tv, and looking at the lyrics from the song you are listening to have still not been implemented into the app in December 2020! I find this ridiculous and I would not recommend giving a company that doesn’t listen to its subscribers more money. Apple music is a much better option and the issues I mentioned above are all taken care of on that app. Not to mention, if you don’t have premium, the user experience will be even worse and they will flood you with loads of ads that promote their premium subscription and nothing else. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because the algorithm is good and it recommends great music based on what you listen to.",Anhdkdksbabs
Spotify,2018-02-26 04:27:38,Awesome! Not so much for phone...,5,"It’s an amazing app. There’s a reason a bunch of people use it and love it. I also love it. On iPads, tablets, computers, etc. you can (without premium) play any song with an occasional 30 second ad per 30 minutes. It’s worth it, and the sound quality with the actual song is good, too. It has basically, everything you need for music, and you don’t need premium to enjoy it, which I and surely many other people appreciate that. However, on the phone version, you must have premium to do almost everything, or else you’d have to shuffle play your song list and you can’t play specific songs on demand.

That’s really annoying and I cannot remove them, and sometimes it only plays the music the app added, and it won’t allow me to skip to the songs I added myself. Unless I’m doing something wrong, that’s a feature I find really annoying. Also if you don’t have premium the app is pretty dry. A lotta ads too, if you don’t have premium. Like, 3 ads every few songs? I don’t get it but oh well I guess. Yeah I’d recommend it if you have money but other than that maybe not. Back to the feature that adds songs to your playlist without permission, is there a way I could turn that off? Rarely it adds music I like, but most of the time it’s music I’m uninterested in and just a waste of time because then I try to skip them but it’s always the songs it added to my list. What the hell?

Spotify,2020-03-23 13:47:30,Lots of bugs- please fix!,2,"- whenever I try to open a podcast or artist on my iPhone, it takes wayyyy longer to load that it used to. A lot of times it doesn't even load and it's only a black screen, doesn't even say there's an error or no connection. I have to restart the app for it to work. It's been happening for the past 3 months probably.

-Between my account on my iPhone, and my account on my MacBook, they don't reflect the same recently listened to music or podcasts. It's like the MacBook only has history for music that I've listened to directly on the MacBook.

The Apple watch app is often unresponsive and needs a lot of improvement. The current podcast/song playing screen often doesn't match up with what my iPhone is playing and is very laggy. Most of the time, the buttons don't work when I push them. Or I have to push them multiple times. Or they don't respond at all. Another problem is that using the crown to change the volume by often lags and it takes several seconds for the noise level to update. Or sometimes I'll use the crown, it changes the volume but in seconds it reverts back to its previous volume.

Last comment- I pay for premium but I get so many podcast ads, more than I used to and most of them aren't voiced by the podcasters. I think it's pretty ridiculous that I pay extra to not hear ads and I still have to hear random ones in podcasts. 😟",Warts wants a rematch

Now, they have made their app so completely awful that the only way to actually enjoy it would be to own an overpriced membership. These features include (of my knowledge) not being able to play a specific song, only 6 skips, (not as bad) for some reason it will just play random songs not on your playlist, (very inconvenient if you’re out of skips) which I think is tho most outrageous. If I have a playlist of liked songs, it shouldn’t play a song that I haven’t pressed like on! If there was one feature I could change/remove, it would be this. It’s also quite stupid that I can’t listen to a specific song, which is literally a bad idea for you developers cause it’s just gonna drive your users AWAY from your platform to listen to that one song.

With drive mode you actually have to press the skip buttons as opposed to swiping. So I never use it. It’s useless in my opinion. Many other annoying things, but I value my time, so I’m not going over everything. Desktop version is so slow it’s nearly useless, with exception to editing playlists using the select all/delete all function that a desktop has to offer... but again, it is soooooo slow!!!!",C R French
Spotify,2019-05-11 22:22:37,I’m in love with this app but..,3,"Ok, so I use this app every day. And I mean EVERY DAY. So it’s pretty clear that I love this app. But it has some problems, like how on all of my other devices, I can skip as many songs as I want, and when I want to listen to certain song, I can just click on it, but that’s not the case on my phone. I don’t know why they just have those privileges on  other devices, but not the phone. Like today, for example. I had been listening to an album and I could just pick a song and listen to it, and I had been doing it for about a week on my phone. But then today, when I went to go listen to the album from the top, it was on shuffle, and I had never put it on shuffle. It’s pretty annoying to have to go through this ONLY on my phone. You could improve this by making the automatic shuffle an on and off thing, other than just turning it on overnight, but that’s just my opinion",Danielle Victorian
Spotify,2019-04-10 13:53:32,Great app but minor issues,4,"Not sure if the devs read the reviews or not, although I’ve had this app for years, it has recently started to peeve me. Within the last week, I am not sure if it is my iPhone or the app, but every time I am playing music and I pause it and lock my phone the app starts playing music by itself. The only way for me to stop the music is to literally close the app. Secondly, the other thing that is starting to annoy me is the song shuffle in my playlist. I have hundreds and hundreds, if not more than a thousand, songs in my playlist, I hate whatever formula you use to determine the shuffling. I feel like the same 50 songs play over and over again. When I am on shuffle I would like to be shuffled through my whole playlist, they are there for a reason and I don’t like when it’s so difficult to listen to them all.",ngb31495

My choice of music is not up for political debate!!! 👎🏽 if I enjoy something they don’t agree with it none of Spotify’s business! I haven’t used this app for a couple months, & l am looking at all the other options! I Loved this app. They just needed to figure out they’re advertising. I don’t mind the commercials just one at a time, & don’t make me have to wait threw 2 minutes of would you like 30 minutes without commercials, & then 20 seconds after I watch a commercial! Just get it over with! So now that they are running commercials, they turn the volume on them to 10👎🏽 Lately if I find a playlist I’m interested in, I can’t look threw it, I have to just listen to it! 👎🏽",Chevelle Laguna Guy
Spotify,2023-03-22 02:35:42,Medical emergency,3,"I’m writing this to raise an alarm because I believe someone at your company may be hurt. Clearly, someone in control of updates fell, suffered severe head trauma, and then did not seek medical attention prior to updating the app recently. This is evident by the removal of the ability to “like” a song. Now one must click into a song, select add to playlist, and then select “Liked Songs” to accomplish the same task.

Why someone would add steps into this process when no users have asked for anything resembling this is indicative of seriously disturbed behavior. Please look out for your employees well being as this could be a sign of someone needing help! perhaps pass out anonymous questionnaires to see if anyone has suffered any injuries they may not feel comfortable seeking treatment for? I do hope your healthcare plans are adequate to get the afflicted employee the help they desperately need.",RonnyGene
Spotify,2022-07-28 02:48:56,Great but not great 🙂✋,2,"So basically I’m always using this app to listen to music but for some reason today it was playing a song and it just stopped playing like it just stopped it didn’t pause it stopped. That kept happening with every song, it would play one song and then it stopped it has happened to me before but I didn’t mind but this time it kept happening I don’t know if it’s because of using that app to much or something I also updated it to see if that was the reason and it still didn’t work. OverallI really enjoy listening to music and this app I hope everything stays the same and premium doesn’t take over because many people don’t really want to pay to listen to music. It stops so much though I don’t even overuse it if that’s the problem (overusing it) then it needs to be fixed it just restarts randomly every second and I cant vibe to music for a second so overall OK app 🤷🏻‍♀️",Valeria Davila
Spotify,2021-07-15 22:29:16,Fix Your app,5,"Ok I’m a kinda mad this app right now cause I’m trying to listen my Goated playlist and the two songs in and it goes in a “suggested playlist” and I don’t want to listen that, I want my playlist yet there is no way to get out of it, you to stop, just after song pause have thing that goes “hey, would you like to listen this playlist we made for you based on this one?”. My next complaint is that sometimes when you search a artist and you click on the artist and under there name it lists some of there songs and the says “and more” sometimes it lets you click and shows you and the other time it doesn’t do anything, like wth. Maybe if there weren’t these issues I would give it a 5 start but it does. FIX YOUR APP😡😡😡",ididb

I want to start by saying the music layout is one of my favorites, but that said this keeps app continually crashing. Once while listening to music, the app crashed 3 times during the span of one song. That’s not the only thing, when I go back to the app in order to resume the song, it starts all the way from the beginning. Since I do not have premium there’s no way for me to play it where I had left off. I understand a couple of app crashes here and there but after three in one single song I just stop listening to music all together for the time being. I really do love this app, but times such as these it brings me to both love and hate it.",anna_elizabth
Spotify,2020-06-26 21:34:22,Playlists,5,I love this app the free version is amazing and Premium is even better. One thing I have to complain about is the playlist setup. One you make it there is no turning back. It’s set in stone. You can’t change the order of songs after you make it. It’s annoying because I could have 5 songs by the same artist i row and not be able to change that. One of my artists came out with a new album and I put it in my playlist and it’s just the album songs all in row. I want to be able to change the order of songs after the playlist is made so I don’t have to erase it and then make whole new one so I get the miss I like. Can you add a feature to be able to change the order of songs after the playlist is made.,abrameee jameees
Spotify,2021-06-06 03:48:16,Has a bug,2,"This app has been really frustrating me these last few months.  It keep shutting off the songs I’m listening to at random times.  When I try to see what happened it restarts the song from the beginning.  I looked to see if I had to update it and saw that other people in the reviews were having similar problems.  Please look into this and fix the problem as soon as you can.  Also just a side note this app would be even better it you gave us the option to decide if we want your song suggestions by putting it in the settings or something.  Some playlist I just want to listen to my songs and it gets annoying how new songs that aren’t even from the same artist pop up and you can delete them or another one will come up.  Anyway please fix the bug.  I really enjoy this app and would like to use it after it’s fixed, so please take into consideration the reviews.",JM2115

Spotify,2019-08-24 13:11:23,Ugh! Go back to the ui you used to have that made sense.,1,"This update is retarded. Now a bunch of the songs that I had saved (I mean “heart icon-ed” which is different than saving it, which is dumb. Are there really that many illiterate users that you need a symbol?) from artists that I wasnt following are nonsensically difficult for me to find. Various artists? Forget it. Now it is even harder to deal with them. Who thought this was a good idea, this is going to kill the growth of your company if you dont fix it. Just... revert versions? Why does nobody ever do that?
Also, why did you guys get rid of the a-z navigation abd then put it back weird? Who wanted to get rid of that. That is an incredibly stupid thing to do. Dont listen to their end user design ideas anymore. Are there other spotify-like platforms? Probably. I’m going to have to figure that out soon, which will be time consuming and sad because I love you guys. Or at least, I used to.

Spotify,2018-05-03 04:08:16,"Good, not great",3,"Overall, the app is pretty good. Automatic radio stations and help making playlists are some pretty good features. Some subtle discovery songs will be snuck in which is pretty nice. But some parts are pretty wack. If you accidentally like a song, you can’t unlike or dislike it and it will frequently show up wherever you liked it. Sometimes video ads won’t load while I’m driving which kills my music until I reach a safe place to completely restart the app. Maybe I’m cheap, maybe they could sacrifice a few pixels. I do genuinely appreciate the deals they’ve made with the 30 minute ad free ads. Behind the scenes (recommendations and such) it seems pretty user friendly but it’s not as user friendly as it could be. I don’t understand why I wouldn’t be able to change a like and perhaps it’s more difficult than I think, but it’s almost non negotiable when you have a like dislike system.",Are you still watching?

Spotify,2021-07-11 11:56:53,Strong arming me to get premium,1,"The parameters that they force you through while listening on free mode are pretty ridiculous. I could deal with the limited skips, occasional ad and shuffle only but recently I’ve noticed that they have doubled and even tripled the amount of ads that I have been getting while listening. Occasionally when you hit shuffle it will tell you to watch a short video for 30 minutes of free listening, and it used to work fine but recently I have been getting 3-4 ads after activating this prompt, and then promptly receiving 3-4 more ads after listening to 1 or 2 songs. Where’d my 30 mins of free listening go? If they’re gonna slight me they might as well just get rid of the feature.  I would say just to ignore the prompt but they will play ads anyway even if you ignore it.  It seems that the pop up is simply acting as a way for them to force even more ads on us through dangling the carrot of uninterrupted listening over our heads.",ta2562

It will tell me “30 minutes and free” then give me ten minutes. It will play 4 maybe 5 ads in a row but when I first got it a few years ago it only played 2 together at most. I guess you could say I’m just really disappointed. I’m happy with the unlimited playlist space and the HUGE variety of music but the ads have got to SLOW DOWN.

I can't afford to pay $10 a month and I mostly listen to my music on the road. This morning I went to listen to one of my playlists and it just was so glitchy. It said I was listening to another song when I know for a fact that I was not listening to the song it said I was. This really bothered me. I tried pausing and playing it again to see if that would fix it but then it just skipped it and starting playing music I really don't like. I tried listening to other stuff but I really wanted to listen to my favorites. I went back to it and it only played my recommend stuff which is probably the worst recommend playlist I have ever heard because I didn't like any of the stuff they played for me. The only reason I give this 2 stars is the fact that they have all the music I want in stead of me having to pay $15 for a soundtrack.,Ssshhhhhhhh

Almost 80% of my music I listen to, I discovered through this app! I don’t know what I ever did without it!!!! The only problem I have is a small glitch where every once in a while it says I don’t have premium even though I do and I have to redo the info and stuff. I think it’s because I don’t live at the address listed on it since we used my friends address for the info, but I’m not sure. STILL AWESOME THOUGH!

I don’t really care about random facts about a song when I could have the lyrics. Also the shuffle could be wayyyy better. It’s very repetitive. In addition, some small features could help.

And even if you “hide” it in your playlist, new ones just get added in replacement! How am I suppose to listen to the songs that I chose, when these other ones just keep popping up?

And every device in the house with the app is going to go through the same bs for the same already-updates set of speakers.

My 4th issue with your app is it automatically plays song I didn’t meant to listen and I have to fast forward to the other song I also didn’t want to listen you can’t just automatically play a song I didn’t mean to listen. My 5th and final issue with your app is that I can’t even replay the song or playing it again,CloudyFoam
Spotify,2020-11-10 08:44:27,Missing a feature,5,My app updated on its own and I no longer have the liked songs feature that appears underneath the follow button of an artist. It was such an easy hassle free way of playing and finding any song from a single artist without having to look through multiple albums and single albums just to get to certain songs and now that its gone I have to struggle going through albums and searching my liked playlist etc just to get to certain songs that I’d easily be able to find before with said feature. Please bring it back it I was a very very helpful feature when in a rush and needing to put something on without having to fiddle with playlists im not in the mood to listen to.,Eli 👿💸💰
Spotify,2021-08-07 15:27:26,Downloading a podcast episode forever blocks the video,2,"The music part of the app is fine, but if you’re using it to watch a podcast there’s a HUGE flaw in the design. If you’re about to go on a drive where your signal could be patchy or you’re trying to save on data charges, it’s nice to have the option of downloading episodes ahead of time, but you don’t want to save hours worth of video. Problem is, when you download a podcast as audio only, you are forever blocked from viewing the video version of that episode. You can’t get the video version back even if you delete the download or change your settings to not download episodes as audio only. This is especially frustrating for a show like the Joe Rogan Experience, where you can’t view the videos anywhere else. Sometimes they’re describing a relevant graphic or a video clip, but you’re stuck with just the audio version.",Aazeleh
Spotify,2021-01-22 02:12:27,Goodish app—not for young kids,4,"So the app is good, I like how you can make playlists and share them with your friends, but there is just ONE thing I don’t really like: on some songs, it has a “behind the lyrics” thing that tells you what the songs are supposed to mean. This is ok, except for some songs it has some inappropriate language. For example, “Can’t Feel My Face” by The Weeknd, the song is NOT explicit, it has no swear words or anything, so it would be suitable for children of any age to listen to this song. But, little kids may not know that the song is about drugs, because it never actually says that “she” is actually cocaine. However, in the behind the lyrics, it talks about the effects of cocaine, and has snippets of conversations with The Weeknd, in which he says some language that I wish was not there. That is all I have to say.

Spotify,2020-07-22 23:23:56,Kinda disappointed,5,"I got two problems, the first being not knowing how to pay for premium. It says you can’t pay in the app but there isn’t an explanation on why and it doesn’t even tell us how to get it. But I guess I’m fine with that since I only want premium to stop listening in shuffle, don’t get me wrong I’m fine listening in shuffle it’s just it wouldn’t be a problem if you don’t add songs to my playlists. What I’m getting at is once you are done with one month free premium you are not only forced to listen in shuffle but along with the shuffle you added songs that I don’t find interest in. I hope you take the time to read this and consider at least fixing the songs you added to my playlist I don’t want",lewisthelion
Spotify,2020-03-16 03:54:44,Longtime premium user,5,"My absolute favorite music streaming service. Granted, I’ve been a premium user from the jump. I love the ability to set the streaming quality to high. Which I always leave on, WiFi or not. I also like toggling the equalizer depending on the genre I’m listening to. I have quite a few lengthy organized playlist, depending on what I’m in the mood for. Each with their own creative names and emoji. 

I think it would be cool to have a more social element to the iPhone app. Such as a “listening to now” feature for friends. Also, more personalization options for profiles. Like more easily changing your picture and display name from the app. Maybe even a bio. The ability to highlight your favorite playlist through arranging them. I think there’s a lot of untapped potential in that area. 

I would also like to be able to rearrange songs in existing playlist within the iPhone app, no matter the sort choice (Recently added etc). Not just from the desktop app. This is especially useful for longer playlist. Also the ability to edit the playlist description and the album covers that are displayed with it. 

Overall great app that compliments everyday life for the avid music listener.",Mindseyepaints
Spotify,2020-06-13 07:20:28,I love this app but...,3,"I really love this app, but there’s just a few things that need to be changed right away otherwise I’m just gonna use a different music app. I HATE how everything is organized. Like for example, when I hear a song, and I really like it, so I try and see more songs from the same artist, but the only way I can do that, is searching up the name of the artist on the search bar. I think you should be able to access all of the songs of an artist without having to search it up. Also, everything is so unorganized. I just hate it. Every time I try to play a song after I search it up, I can’t listen to it right away without having to skip a few songs even though I tapped the option to have that song played. I just think that the app should be made to where it could be easily used with no interruptions.",@ight...bet

 I do have one idea: I currently have a collaborative playlist that I share with my cousins, and I would like to receive notifications whenever a song is added. It would make it easier to know which songs were added. If you want you don't have to say who added it, just say something like ""A song has been added to your playlist [playlist name]"". If multiple songs get added in a short time, then say like ""[# of songs] was added to your playlist [playlist name]"".

If you don't want to do notifications, you could just let us know in the app if songs were added rather than us opening the playlist and scrolling all the way down.",xxk3990

This and every other corporate entity needs to do better at listening to vulnerable and marginalized people.

We need to do everything in our power to include everyone in feeling accepted and safe. Thank you.

Spotify,2018-05-12 00:43:33,Great but question/problem,3,"It’s a very great app allowing me to listen to my favorite songs but it seems as if some of my songs just auto skip and disappear from my playlist and when I search it it doesn’t pop up when I go to the artist’s songs it is missing is this an issue or did I press a button to make it never show up again? I’m very confused other than that I love this app!👍

Edit: I also am kinda frustrated at the songs that are recommended to me that has nothing with my other songs for example if I create let’s say a 80’s playlist it will play the latest song that came out it’s really frustrating for me when I create a certain playlist and songs with a very different type are played. When I get advertisements it freezes and I have to restart the app can this be fixed please no advertisements show up only the thing that says advertisements on top",Jerrylolguy
Spotify,2023-03-28 19:15:26,2 major bugs that annoy like crazy,2,"The 2 bugs out of which one is a true bug, make using this app really frustrating. The bug is that if after creating a queue of songs to play, you connect to any Bluetooth device, the queue disappears with no way of replicating what you wanted to listen to. Incredibly annoying, especially if you drive a car and actually want to listen to stuff in a specific order as there seems to be no way to set your likes songs the way you want them. So queue is the only way. Totally useless here. The second thing is that the app recommends to you new playlists/mixes that almost entirely consist of songs that you played and so no new music appears there which is sort of against the idea I think. I don’t really know how to force it to really recommend something that I may like but new to me. It’s been this way for years and I actually pay for this app!",babciakrysia
Spotify,2022-02-26 05:52:50,Performance Issue,4,"it’s a wonderful app and i’ve been using it for as long as i can remember, and it’s the most convenient way for me to listen to my music while i do homework, clean, cook, whatever. As of lately however, i can’t play my music and it’s more inconvenient than it is helpful. the issue is i will try to play a song, and it will either freeze and won’t play, or it will play the first 9-12 seconds then stop. i’m mostly upset because i have all of my music downloaded, but i’ve found the only way to fix this is to exit the app and it will auto-pause, then it will work but it’s tedious doing this for every single song, some of which won’t even play. i don’t know what happened but since about a week and a half ago it’s been a hassle to listen to music :/",kalgal05

But when I’m playing my likes songs, it plays random songs in the middle of it while I’m still staying to listen to mine. For example I was listening to my music while playing some games. I know all my songs and I knew that I hadn’t finished my liked songs because I didn’t here my 5 favorite songs. (That’s a lot but just yeah). It started playing country music! No offense but country is not my favorite music group thing. It was so weird. It only does this for people without premium. We don’t have enough money for that kinda stuff right now and I just don’t think it’s very fair. If u are having issues with your liked songs like me, then you would understand. If you can afford premium get it, you don’t have any commercials or random songs playing.",yathatguy...

I have a playlist with 300+ songs on it that I have been adding songs to it for years, so there are countless songs that are getting old and I skip every time. But with a playlist that is so long, it’s really annoying to have to go to the “edit playlist” button and search through your entire list to find songs you want to delete. It would be nice to be able to click on the three dots in the corner while you’re listening to a song and, right next to the option to add it to a playlist, you could also delete it from a playlist right from there. I would be able to update my playlist much faster!",Syd.E.E.

And every time I play it I hear songs I didn’t put in, also when I don’t want the “we added” music in MY own playlists, it just creates ANOTHER playlist full of the songs u guys add without my permission. I don’t like the format of the update, and plus it really irritates me that u have this white bar on the bottom saying “added to playlist” I really really don’t need that in the way every time I wanna add music to my music, I was okay with it at first, but now It irritates me on just how slow it goes away.

Spotify,2018-10-29 23:51:54,Sometimes frustrating with new update and ads,3,"The new update made some unnecessary changes which I’m not fan of. But my biggest annoyance is that there are so many ads. Before, it used to be one ad every ten or so songs. Now it seems between every other song I listen to has an ad, or multiple. 

Also the raising of premium rates didn’t make me too happy. I realize the company needs to make money but really? I can listen to an ad for 30 minutes of ad free music but it ONLY applies to the playlist I was currently listening to. 

Seems a little greedy and it’s super annoying when I’m listening to calming music and  3 ads interrupt every other second. I suggest they make it less frustrating for users and have 30 minutes of ad free music that applies to ALL playlists, as well as some rewards like maybe on your birthday you can get an hour of ad free listening or maybe more skips.",We all family

Honestly it still seems a bit jumbled and I don’t see how removing browse from the bottom bar helps make things “easier” but at least they aren’t gone. Also why would you put the intro video about all the changes under search and not on the front page? Clearly it took me awhile to find it and until I did I was very upset about the changes! 

Where did all the features go? Seems like each new update is a failed attempt to “streamline” the look while ruining the functionality of the app. Where is browse? Where is discover? Where are moods and literally half the app? You’re telling me now I’ll have to either search for things randomly or select from whatever you want to show me on my home screen and nothing else?

I don’t know what happened but they decided to change the overall experience. Instead of “saving” artists you now have to “follow” them? They made this update back in 2019 and there are forums of people just ranting about how much they hate the new user interface. I personally sent them a few emails asking them to change it back. As the years have gone, it seems like they just keep trying to make it worse and worse. I hate this app now.

Spotify,2022-11-03 15:38:35,It’s crazy how bad this app is,2,"None of these issues are new.

- There’s no way to actually turn autoplay off for podcasts despite what appears in the settings. The functionality isn’t there.  
- Hitting rewind on the Lock Screen interface (instead of the app itself) will skip back to the last time the app was actually viewed on your phone. Could be anywhere from 40 seconds to 40 minutes. Good luck!  
- Episodes will randomly restart, losing all progress and current timestamp. Or, even more fun, it will randomly “complete” the current episode and start playing another one, regardless of whether it has been downloaded or is on a playlist.  
- Video never plays longer than 3 seconds or so before freezing. The episode is fully downloaded, and I’m in my house on wifi anyway. The functionality isn’t there. Closing and restarting the app doesn’t work. Uninstalling and reinstalling doesn’t work.

If it weren’t for the monopoly on a certain podcast, I would never use this app again.  Instead of funding exclusivity as a way to gain users, more resources should be diverted to the app dev team. There’s apparently no leadership or QA. I guess I’m proof that idiots will still use the app because of content even if the user experience is sub-par, so congrats to the business division.

A main reason i am writing this review is because of a new Bug that is occurring for many users including myself. I think it is only on IOS devices but it may be on all platforms, that i do not know for sure. But the Bug is when we play our music for 5-10 minutes sometimes longer and then out of nowhere the app shuts off the music. Almost as if it’s lost connection? This is happening while being a Premium member so don’t tell me offline listening isn’t an option. Please address this Bug, i and many other people are having our music shut off for no apparent reason. 

I’ll note that i am using an iPhone 11 so my device is fully capable. My only other concern is the fact that you guys add unwanted music to our playlists despite us taking it off already. We take 1 song off that you suggested, you add another. That’s horrible business practice and if anything will deter people from purchasing Premium, not the other way around. 

Fix this Bug, and please stop cramming unwanted songs into our playlists. Thank you.",shahhahash

First of all, the tracks you suggest blow and have nothing in common with my Favorites. Second, if I skip them it uses my skips and you continue to play crappy music that isn’t on my playlist. Why don’t you offer several paid tiers of subscriptions instead of just one? People can pay a smaller fee and have more skips, start wherever they want, or have ads still but less of them. 

While I love the variety and the choice to add virtually any song you want to a playlist there is a huge issue. It doesn’t matter how many times you update the app or log out then back in it never plays any playlists on shuffle. Ever!

3. If I have a song duplicate and attempt to delete one of them, it ends up deleting both songs because they share the name. At this point I keep the duplicates for the sheer fact that I don’t want to sort through my 1600 songs all over again.

A recent experience: opened app and started a song but decided to skip it, three ads, next song was also not quite what I was looking for, so skipped ahead, 3 more ads, fast forwarded next song and got four ads. Sometimes I have also noticed that the videos that promise 30 minutes of uninterrupted music fall short of delivering that much time. 

Moral of the story is that if you get a paid subscription this is a 4-5 star app but if you want to stick with the free version it’s 1-2 stars due to the incredibly high volume of ads.",KindaChrome64
Spotify,2020-06-13 14:30:17,Great app but some things have to be fixed,4,"I’ve been using this app for about a year and I’ve had a great experience. But there are some problems. Sometimes when you’re listening to your playlist or something you get three ads in a row. THREE! And then there’s the ad disliking button. You’d think once you say “I’ve heard it too many times” the ad would stop showing up. But guess what? It just shows up again, and again, and again until you eventually throw the phone. Next up is the video ads. There’s a reason that there’s a button for reporting explicit content, to report explicit content. But the video ads don’t have that button. Instead the video ads just get to curse all they want because you can’t report a video ad. Overall I like the app but the problems with the ads must be fixed",igthisiswhereidie

Randomly I’ll be listening to my playlist and a random song comes up, and it won’t let me skip it with every time just a pop up saying it’s a premium feature and that I should learn more. I’ve only used 1 skip so this is annoying if I wanna skip something I want to skip it. This is happening for at least three songs in a row and that they’re recommended for me. None of the songs have I liked yet and I just want to listen to the ones in my playlist, and I can’t even skip it when I have enough skips. And it goes on for at LEAST three songs?! To be honest this is extremely annoying and it makes me upset to the point where I’m debating if I should switch to where I listen to my songs on.",ImHarlieee

But something happened or changed back??? I had an update and when I liked it I could add the song to the playlists I selected. I lover thé update, it was so much easier to add one song to multiple playlists at the same time and if I wanted to unlike a song and un add it to a playlist I could see what playlist it was on without searching. I don’t know what happened, but it was one of my favorite updates you have installed into the app. I am disappointed that I went to add a song and the update disappeared. I still love the app!

Spotify,2019-03-29 23:17:26,"Awesome App, but....",4,"Like I said in the header this app is amazing to be able to have easy access to almost every some known to man on your pocket device, but with the most recent interface update I cannot condone a 5-star rating. I have used this app for years now and it was really good prior to the new interface.

Before this new interface you could view saved artists in your library and listen to all albums with out needing to add them to the queue. Now without that function you’re forced to set up a queue or playlist to listen to all albums in a row or shuffled. Specifically for me, this was a quality of life functionality that allowed me to listen to all albums of 1 band with 1 click.

Also there is a noticeable lack of notifications for new albums of bands you have followed or aced to your library and I would love if that was a feature so I don’t have to check every 2-3 weeks for new albums of every band I listen to on a daily. 

If these things get corrected in a future update, I will increase my star rating to 5. For now though it stays at 4-stars. These interface “upgrades” should not have happened in the first place considering the app was easy to use before hand. A touch up, rather than a full rework would have been better.",Monkeyface98
Spotify,2019-01-25 18:38:30,"Disappointing, intrusive, malfunctions",1,"This app has the cheap cologne smell of amateur music “experts” steering a popular but shortsighted tech giant.  Users and potential abound with no sign of common sense.

I tried this app because it was recommended by several friends, but it seems to be fraught with bugs, sleazy sales tactics, and low-quality A.I.

The app kept playing after I closed the app, it would be playing music in my pocket, and when I double-clicked on my home button (iOS) no apps were running.  When you no longer have control of your device, you’ve officially fallen victim to a virus or malware. The only way to get the music to stop was to delete the app from my iPhone.

The algorithms don’t pick up on your taste in music or favorite styles of music very well at all.  Most of the music the app came up with, The main reason I wanted to try this app,  was very low quality, generic, simplistic music of an adjacent genre or sub-genre.  I ended up hearing the kind of garbage that you hear on pay to play FM radio stations now. The entirety of this companies resources weren’t able  to introduce me to a single new artist or song of any substantial quality.

The app aggressively tried to launch other apps on my phone and connect to them, which is pretty inappropriate behavior at the height of all of the privacy problems were having with app developers. If I want to connect my social media or my navigation to my music, I’ll let you know.",Wheaty tx

Only premium members can listen to the entire song. It’s annoying because when you want to just listen to a song you have to wait until the playlist gets to that song so you have to listen to the playlist until you get there.

Snapchat,2022-09-14 20:07:29,Love it but have suggestions!,5,"I’ve used Snapchat as my main communication app since it first came out! It’s a great way to stay connected with friends, post polls for my trivia gig, and it’s a relatively safe way to communicate with people met online (like online dating) who you don’t know well enough or aren’t comfortable enough to give your personal number out to. 
Many great features have been added to Snapchat over the years that are perfect for even simple quality of life and it’s insanely user friendly. However, there are a couple of things that still need fixing or adding even after all these years! First fix is to add a setting to completely turn off the apps shutter sound when taking a picture that doesn’t involve me silencing my phone completely. The sound is incredibly loud and obnoxious and draws WAY too much attention so it’s really gotta go. Second fix is that if a video snap has multiple parts that record smoothly it shouldn’t arrive to you in multiple different notifications! I have several friends who I maintain conversations with using the longer video feature that was added quite a while back which is super fun and convenient but when I receive my friends replies the video will send a notification for each individual section as if they are separate videos/snaps. This is also incredibly obnoxious when I’m in public or at work and can’t turn my phone on silent for whatever reason.",BootleDoos

If you have Snapchat, you don’t need FaceTime what’s up or like I don’t think you can talk with your family or cousins not friends because it’s already on Snapchat everything off that you were really enjoyed that and have you guys looking at this so I have I didn’t mean to Brasilia while I was gonna like tell you guys about it so I am thank you again, so yeah if I messed it up sorry but you would enjoy it. I enjoy it a lot and if you’re good night get it enjoy it because yeah you will you will enjoy it and if someone are you and you do feel like you want to add them because you can if use like you should add them you don’t have to bye💗 oh, and one more thing people you can see people location, but you can take it off if you want to",i guess this is briana

I like how it’s sort of creepy in a good way and how you can see when people screenshot, leave you on opened, or anything else that you would need to notice. Also the bitmojis in the corner to see if their online or not. Oh yea and it’s also safer than normal texting since it doesn’t give your actual phone number I think (although you can still share your location but I turned mine off) Also btw I just want to say that the cameos are a nice idea and all but a little creepy and it’s a little uncomfortable how it makes these videos with me and my friend that get a little out of hand (we’re just friends but I guess not according to cameo stories 💀) also one tiny thing that annoys me is if I go to send someone a picture and I want to scroll up in my camera roll it just thinks I'm scrolling out of the text and it closes it. I hope you understand what I’m talking about. But anyways it’s a great app! Now I’m going to go back to it and watch as my “best friend” keeps leaving me on opened no matter what j say!

Snapchat,2022-11-23 22:36:49,Some glitches ang suggestions for the app :),3,"Have been using this app for years and love how it’s grown but recently have run into some issues in regards to memories. If a video has multiple clips it breaks it up into sections and you can’t edit the sections even if u try to delete them or cut them off, it does nothing and the video remains unchanged when I post it. I prefer how it used to be where u could just see the whole long video and trim off the ends (and save multiples of that in case u don’t want to post the whole thing) 
another issue is now I can’t save multiple videos on my device, im not sure if this has to do w snapchat or the fact i’ve updated my phone. but once I select more than one video it removes the option to save it on my device - and if I select 3 or more it won’t let me post it to my story.
these weren’t issues before and considering I use snapchat as a camera roll and also for content, I would really appreciate these updates being changed! otherwise I love the app
also I was wondering if y’all would ever make it possible to download an archive of all your memories (or even make it a option you pay for) because i have memories dating 6 years back and I would love to always have access to them regardless of service or not and also for like when I get older, it’d be really appreciated not only by me but probably most of your users! this is just a suggestion ofc but would be awesome",Jujujesci
Snapchat,2023-03-07 00:18:18,Give a warning before locking accounts,3,"Hello, I’m a frequent Snapchat user and recently my account has been permanently locked. Many people do not read the community guidelines before using the app and yes that is not the creators fault all in all. Though I suggest that at least 1 warning is given before permanently locking accounts. My account had many important memories on it that I lost all because I didn’t read the guidelines. I lost text with people who were important to me that I’m no longer in contact with, I lost the memories of my pets when I first got them and as they grew, i lost memories of how I used to be and look, I lost memories with my bestest of friends, I lost my world. I also use Snapchat to contact and talk to all of my friends, I don’t have their numbers or other socials so I don’t know how I will talk to them anymore. I understand the guidelines are to be followed and are an important part of the app to keep it up. Though I suggest that instead of just permanently locking accounts you consider how many people have everything on snap. Instead you can ban them from posting, and sharing explicit content; if they choose to continue to not follow the guidelines then it is acceptable to ban their account for a year or two and then after that a permanent lock should be put in place. Please consider this as i am at a lost for words of all the memories I’ve just lost.",creepy kelpto detective
Snapchat,2023-02-18 22:41:17,Bots,3,"I love Snapchat and I’ve been using Snapchat for as long as maybe 2018. I recently made a new account so I could get more friends but I have noticed over 50% of my friends on Snapchat are not even real accounts. I’ve noticed the most common account is some porn star she has over I’d say 1,000 accounts on there. It’s the same bitmoji each and every time but a different name. I’ve accidentally added the accounts before and they will have been weeks apart from the other account and it’s the same snaps and videos but they are live and her snap score is always super low. She must have something that automatically makes accounts for her but it’s super annoying. Onto the next type of bots often there are lots and lots of people that have the same copy and pasted paragraph saying “$300 a day no fee I’ll be your sugar mommy” or something along the lines of that, it’s a scam and they try to take your money. Most recent scam I’ve been seeing that’s very dangerous is they will text you pretending to be an artist saying they will paint your picture and pay you 5,000 dollars for it. It’s dangerous because they ask for your address and your email and your phone number and your first and last name. Giving out all your personal information is very scary and dangerous.

Snapchat,2022-12-18 17:05:13,"Amazing app, my friends and I love it.",5,"It’s a great app, most of my high school uses it. It’s the perfect way to keep in-touch with all of your homies on the weekends or after school. It’s super easy to use, there is little to no delay in video and voice calls, as well as messages. The format makes it easy to read texts and send them, and it’s super convenient to send a one-time picture that doesn’t take up any space on your camera roll, but if you want, you can save all pictures taken to your device. Posting to your story is an easy way to share your adventures (or just daily life) with your friends (and I mean only your friends, which makes it safer than a lot of other social media apps) and you can tag other friends in your story if they’re in the the picture or you just want them specifically to see it. Streaks is also a great feature to keep in contact with your buddies. It can be just a tradition every morning just for the number or it can be a way to make sure you contact long-distance pals every day. You can also get it on more out-dated devices, like my own device, even if you have a really old iOS. I love this app and I’m sure you will, too!",Panda Pugsley

Snapchat,2022-12-29 04:19:25,Is this good for 10-12 year olds?,4,"I’m really concerned about some inappropriate content that might be put out and that children might see. The app allows 10-12+, which might be a bit concerning considering the content, perverts, thief’s, cyber bullies, and kidnappers. The app is something every kid would probably download, since it’s something and older kid would download and they’d want to download it, too. So when a child would download it, they would post. When they post, there’s an old man, kidnappers, bullies, and thief’s. There’s just so much that could go wrong! But there’s also many positive things. When a child downloads it, they can also contact online friends without giving away their phone number that could be a bit too personal! This also goes for parents. In general, the app is great for socializing and finding ideas for things to do. It’s like Pinterest and iMessages in one. But as a ten year old child, I don’t think it’s safe, I feel a bit uncomfortable on the app, especially since I’m only ten. So really, it’s great for people that know to be careful, and are older. And I don’t think Snap Chats opinion about 12+ is accurate, I think you should be 14+. It’s really not safe at a young age, there’s just so much to go wrong!",changed my life😉😉

2. also make it were it doesn’t say someone screenshots chat or screen records because it’s really annoying. i’m trying to get some gossip but i can’t because it’ll say i screenshoted chat and then i can’t. 

OTHER THAN these issues this is a good app and i love the filters on there and it’s basically the only place i take ( took ) photos.",SaltyCookie😜😜😜
Snapchat,2023-03-01 03:50:30,Very good app but it’s got some flaws,2,"I have been using Snapchat for many years now and it has contained many memories and was the main contacting app. I had contact to friends on Snapchat that I didn’t anywhere else. But one day, I wake up to see that my account has been permanently locked. I was stunned and very surprised at this because I had done nothing wrong. I started to contact Snapchat support and spent days trying to desperately get it back but was all futile. I sent many emails to Snapchat support asking them to unlock it as I did nothing wrong and meant no harm to anyone. And what made me even more confusing, was that there was no reason specified for what I had done wrong. In all of the emails, they all said that I violated the community guidelines yet never actually said what I did wrong. Knowing that I didn’t do anything wrong, I blamed it on Snapchat workers that abused power by banning random people. But as I though about it more, I came to the assumption that I must had been hacked. It would be the only thing that made sense out of all of this. I contacted Snapchat support many times complaining that my account had been compromised and was used for actions that had violated the community guidelines.

the Map is cool and underrated. you can get a peek into what people around town are up to, without having to know or befriend them. useful for following local events as they happen.

occasionally I’ll use the face lenses. I follow a creator who makes some great ones (aoepng, tho searching that name doesn’t bring them up?). the app could do a better job showing you when they upload new filters—right now you have to subscribe to the creator’s story. more focused, thoughtful lists of filters or creators handpicked by actual people (as opposed to the algorithmic FYP feed) could help with finding new filters. I also find it really frustrating that racist and borderline filters are still being let in. can Snap please pass a moratorium on all primate lenses period and maybe hire people with cultural expertise to deny filters depicting culturally specific face paint! not everything irl should be replicated as a filter and made available to anybody to put on themselves.",Nathan F.

I've had multiple simple problems with snap before, but never anything this low down and uncalled for. I've never had my account on timeout, deleted or even temporarily disabled until now because things were reported about me that never happened and even asked to provide evidence or help to resolve this misunderstanding, but snap doesn't want to hear anyones side of they story but the one they think fits best. If this happens to anyone else its more than likely someone not knowing/paying attention to what they are doing and not even giving the matter a second look before accusing someome of an incident that was more than likely reported by someone you arnt really on good terms with and wanted to get back at you.

Snapchat,2023-03-16 06:02:43,eh. gets worse with each update.,1,"i cannot even begin to name all the things snapchat has ruined just by updating. used to be able to reply to stories with voice memos and now its replaced with a group send feature, used to be able to pick photo albums and now the feature just disappeared for some reason, plus you can’t contact snapchat so it’s not like you can tell them what you do and don’t like about the app besides leaving a review. snapchat has really just turned into a cash grab from what it seems like. either that or the development team is so god awfully stupid and doesn’t frequently use the app if they even use it at all so they keep taking away useful features with each update. snapchat literally all we beg you is to stop removing useful features like being able to pick photo albums and stop adding useless features like 3d bitmojis. nobody asked for 3d bitmojis.

not to mention now they’re letting public figures on the app post weed and edibles just because they’re paying for the service, but if literally anyone else posts something remotely similar to weed they’ll get their account deleted. im 22 and live in california and i have it set to that on the app but i’ve lost 2 accounts in the past few months because i posted some edibles WHICH ARE LEGAL FOR ADULTS IN CALI. thanks snapchat for deleting all the memories i had saved of my friends and childhood pet!",professional snapchat hater

Im devastated and left with no explanation. 

look, i NEVER waste my time to write a review, but snapchat done messed up. the story viewing is COMPLETELY out of wack and feels like a mix between like tiktok and insta stories put together. even viewing magazines on there is horrendous. no longer can you swipe up to read a magazine or to reply to someone’s story, but it takes you to the next one. honestly, this might’ve been all i needed to get off of social media. snapchat was the last social i was consistently using, but i have ZERO want to go to view stories or magazines due to this update which would take away half of what i use snapchat for. the update quite literally ruined my morning. nothing about it seems logical to me unless they’re trying to get the tiktok vibe… but that’s not why snapchat is around, nor does it fit with the use of stories. it was a good 8 years snapchat, but i think we might become distant cousins. who knows, maybe the next update will demote you below facebook. is that really what the world is coming to?",@nailnoobs

But, there’s a couple things that just ruin the app. For me at least. The fact that it lets the person know whenever you save something, take a screenshot, or even screen record your chat, isn’t very useful. In fact, i know a couple of friends who have ended their friendships because of this! It only takes one small move, and oops! You just took a screenshot of their story/chat! The person might think you’ve done this in purpose, which can cause problems! I do under stand why this is a thing though. It can help with some problems too. For instance, if you wanted to take a screenshot of something, like a secret they just told you in chat, and you put it on your story, i understand with that. But I’m gonna be honest, i don’t think that’s every going to happen. And even if it did, it probably only happened once or twice.

I really don’t want random accounts coming up and  me having to “hide” them just so new ones can come up again later. That process is frustrating. We should be allowed to choose who we want to follow and not random people, that frankly I don’t even know. And not ALL mutual friends or possible friends are my friends. Sometimes people you know who you don’t want to follow come up and I don’t like that. Please fix this because it’s not cool or fun to force this issue upon us.",Diana L Alexander
Snapchat,2022-10-27 10:24:48,WARNING ! DO NOT TRUST SNAPCHAT.,1,"I would just like to say that I used to love Snapchat. I had it since the year 2013 and had countless memories saved within the app. On August 17th 2022 , my Snapchat account was permanently locked for no reason . Literally from one day to another when I opened the app , I was logged out of my account. Immediately I thought someone had logged into my account and that was why I was logged out ( which is impossible considering the complexity of my password) but when I tried logging in, it said my account had been permanently locked and gave me no reason why. I feel very disappointed with the Snapchat corporation because if they had felt I violated their terms , I would at least like to know what it is I did wrong or violated instead of just closing my account without warning nor giving me a reason why . . Secondly If it was something I did , how did they acquire the knowledge? Was it Artificial intelligence scanning through our data? Or a human looking through our data and pictures? It makes me feel very uncomfortable to think how much of my privacy has been invaded ? I’ve emailed them numerous times already and have not gotten any emails back at all which is strange considering Snapchat is supposed to get back to its customers. If anyone can offer some help I would appreciate it",waxelll
Snapchat,2022-08-30 02:38:52,OMG GET THIS APP,5,This app is so cool it lets you send pictures to friends and family and you can show people around the glop about you adventures and stuff and you can post on a story that is where everyone that you are friends with can see it and you can make it a private story then you can choose who you want to see your videos and you can save pictures and videos and you can change your Bitmoji a Bitmoji is a avatar where you can make it have different hairs and clothes and makeup and (etc) you can even rename people like how ever you won’t you can add music to your videos and pictures they have cool filters and if you don’t like the other filters you can search what kind of filter you want and you can even make a group chat on it with different people that you are friends with and you can name the group chat and the other people in the group chat can change it to you will get a notification that who ever the person is change the group name super cool that is it I RECOMMEND THIS APP🤩🤩🤩,Tori goodin

Snapchat,2023-04-16 08:31:01,Permanently banned me forever,1,"Got permanently banned on March 12th. For sending a picture of my cough medicine. I’ve seen people post/send 100x worse things and still have their accounts running. Completely unfair. I was a loyal member of snapchat for years. I had lots of friends and over 130 thousand memories. Banned my account without warning and within minutes of sending the photo. Emailed them a countless number of times and almost every single time it was an automated message which was completely unhelpful. Refused to unlock my account even after I wrote them paragraphs explaining the situation and that I didn’t deserve my account to be banned. Horrible customer service. I tried and tried but nothing. Finally tried exactly a month later to see if I would have any luck. Instead they told me they now permanently deleted my account forever and now I actually had 0 chance of getting my account back. Completely rigged. I requested to download all my data as well, and they never gave me any of it. Also banned my entire device from being able to use Snapchat, can’t even make a new account. I have to buy a new phone if I want to be able to use Snapchat again. I want something to be done about this situation and the others who have faced this same problem. Thanks a lot snapchat!",Ema.Gomar
Snapchat,2022-12-10 21:46:02,Absolutely terrible experience I have lost all of my photos and friends and so much more do to this,1,"I lost my account for some reason, I’ve reevaluated the tos community guidelines I’ve even gone through snap chat support and have sent several emails regarding my issue and I haven’t even got a word back yet. I have lost my job because of the confusion this caused I’ve now have friends and family who are mad because “I don’t speak to them anymore”. I haven’t done anything wrong on snap the last message I sent was “I love you stay safe and let me know when you get home” so if that’s against community guidelines than I’d say that’s extreme censorship for no reason. I’ve had my significant other even send in emails through the only way to contact Snapchat . I’ve used snap for my personal and my start ups (start ups being a Rv rental business and a modeling agency). Additionally I’ve herd a lot of people in South Carolina and Georgia it’s been happening to them for whatever reason. I know it wasn’t guidelines or tos so the only other thing was it making a mistake on my 3 accounts (1 personal 2 business) of it being “suspicious” additionally I’ve never had to wait longer than a week to get a reply from Snapchat and this isn’t the first time this mistake has happened it happens on my last phone too",chaotic.source

I did too it was back in January on the 28th and I was using snap all fine all day the day before and half the day the day I got temporary  banned. I went and looked how long that would take it said 24 hours so I waited till the next day and tried again.  It’s been 3 months and I still can’t make a new one or nothing. I might have to get a new phone because it won’t let me make a new one on this one I’m really upset at this-because I loved snap that was my go to app and the thing is also is they will let make a new one on a different phone but not mine so snap if your reading this let us have our accounts back because we did nothing wrong to deserve this so let us have snap “temporary banned”. Some of y’all have had it for years and now they doing this. I even did the email thing   Snapchat needs to realize what their doing because they can’t just be doing that that’s stupid but I’m telling y’all they don’t care so i might have to get a new phone or something I have a iPhone 13 rn and I just got it in November. They need to give our accounts back now 😡😡😡😡😡",Lelani Munoz 🤍
Snapchat,2022-11-03 04:29:15,TERRIBLE Support Center,1,"A few days ago I was permanently locked out of my account with no warning and with no explanation. I have not violated any guidelines nor do I have any third party apps. I tried contacting Snapchat on every possible social media platform to which they responded: sorry we can’t help you anymore here; go to our support website. So I did. I selected the option of “my account has been locked,” described my situation and was sent a message saying “your account has been permanently locked.” That’s it. Then I tried clicking the “my account has been compromised” option. The same response. There is no other way to contact the support team for personalized help. Only got automated messages and not even an explanation as to why my account was locked. I tried to make a new account but couldn’t because my account is still active technically even though it’s locked so I can’t verify my phone number or email. I have put in a data retrieval request in hopes of getting my memories and friends back but I have not heard back from them yet. Then I will have to delete my account through the support center so I can use my email and phone number to make a new account. Apparently this has happened to a bunch of people recently for no apparent reason. We are livid.",tBear1901!2000
Snapchat,2022-11-23 16:04:53,Ad death,1,"What is with the insane amount of ads? It’s become ridiculous at this point. Some subscriptions you get 10 seconds of content for 5.99 seconds minimum of advertisement. The worst part is that they’re un-skippable until the time has completed. Is it that hard to add a feature that actually skips the ad after the required time once you’ve already tapped the screen? Or a setting to auto-skip ads once required time is reached (but a button you can tap if you are interested to see the rest)? Way to force people to be glued to their devices and feed the social media addiction that is so prevalent. Like, sometimes I want to enjoy Snapchat stories/subs while I’m busy with my hands but I can’t because it will be stuck on a repeating advertisement or a repeating, 3-minute movie trailer. Smart design but also terrible and I hate you guys for it. I’m sure your investors love it though!

I’ve had Snapchat for about a decade and while I love a lot of the features that have been added, it’s just become another social media moneymaking machine. They seem to care more about the profit than the user experience, which is a far cry from where they started. At least Facebook/IG stories doesn’t force their advertisements down your throat, three taps and they’re skipped.",rbux333
Snapchat,2022-12-09 17:18:20,Terrible Customer Service,1,"Yesterday, I was permanently locked out of my Snapchat account. 1) Snapchat does not even inform you what action specifically made them lock your account. 2) They block you from submitting a case/appeal if you are permanently locked out, and in my case as well as thousands of others, I know for a fact that I was wrongfully locked out of my account and I can’t even reach out to Snapchat customer support. This makes me believe that Snapchat really doesn’t care about its users. 3) I have thousands of memories dating back to my childhood that I often look through, but now I can never access them again because of this heinous error on Snapchat’s end. I have thoroughly looked through all Snapchat’s Terms of Service and reasons for permanent lockout, and none of them applied to me and I know that for a fact. The only possible thing I could think of was the fact that I was on a public wifi at the time of lockout, but even then, I wasn’t even using the app when they locked me out. Snapchat needs to do better and supply better customer service for me and the thousands of others this has happened to so we can continue using the app to message our friends and look at our old memories. I am extremely upset and disappointed.",The coscino kid
Snapchat,2023-04-11 17:56:20,Took them 7 years too ruin something good,1,"Never once really had a problem with Snapchat and I mean that honestly Iv gone 7 years sending snaps receiving running up the snap score doing the streaks. It’s been a blast honestly and perfect running app. But when I decide ok I’m done I don’t need these guys anymore and I decide to make a new account like I would on any other app, for no reason should people on discord or other apps I’m connected to get notified I just made a new account. That defeats the purpose. I created a new account to start over and get away from all the people I was friends with before and the second I add a new account it suggest friends from my old account and not only that Iv gotten 3 people on discord already ask me did I make a new Snapchat account becuse the names are the same. That’s ridiculous. Iv never seen a more social media invasion of privacy and I am Officialy done with Snapchat. Like im sorry but that’s just one of those things we’re it’s like why did you think this was a good option to implement.I don’t see this being a fixable issue in the future either so this isn’t one of this “im gonna say im done and hope they fix it” y’all won’t read this lol.

Snapchat,2022-11-19 04:29:10,Terrible!,2,"I have an old Snapchat account that I’ve had for years now it has many pictures and memories on it however I put most if not all of these pictures into “my eyes only” as it was hard to look at them and not cry or cringe or both. Just recently I’ve wanted to get them all back because I realized they’re precious memories no matter the circumstance. Unfortunately I forgot my pin for “my eyes only” and I’ve tried multiple combinations but nothings working! I saw I could press “forget password/pin” which usually helps reset the pin or password you’ve forgotten, but I can’t press it because if you go through with trying to reset the pin it will delete all of the pictures within “my eyes only”. I’d really like this to be changed because I know there has to be others that had put precious memories in it thinking they were too embarrassing and later realized they’re not really embarrassing and wanted to get them back out but forgot the pin for “my eyes only” only to realize if they reset the pin all those memories are gone!

Snapchat,2022-10-02 06:31:16,LOOOVEEEE,5,"Snapchat is easily my main app, I don’t find anything wrong with it, except the fact they can see that you screenshot stuff, but it’s understandable to not let people invade privacy. The only thing I ask, is adding highlights into the hair treatments on the bitmoji stuff, I have black hair with blonde highlights, and my bitmoji looks so boring without the highlights. Ohhhh and possibly some anime stuff, like a Demon Slayer collection of clothes, I know many would love that. Overall I love Snapchat and don’t see any thing that needs attention asap. Hopefully you can add highlight treatments!

- also something I wish there was, is a select all button, where I can select every single person on my snap and block them all, rather then going through and blocking each individually, there’s easily over 500 people on my snap, and I only really have like 45 people that I want on snap.

Snapchat,2023-04-07 03:18:11,Snapchats an amazing app but spotlight needs a lot of work,4,"I’ve recently joined Snapchat about a year ago and it’s been a nice way for me to communicate with others. I will cut to the point by saying that I think that y’all should lower the restrictions and guidelines for spotlight. I get that are trying to have different forms of entertainment but when it comes to making it on Snapchat, it’s really hard.  From personal experience, since I can’t have TikTok I choose to post my edits on Snapchat spotlight. Every single time I do this however, it is never chosen for spotlight. My edits literally have nothing wrong with them and they have my water mark with my sounds. I find it a little annoying how I can post these edits in every platform but Snapchat. Considering the fact that Snapchat is one of the most useful and popular social media platforms, I suggest making the choice of lowering these restrictions into consideration. ( Sorry if I sound like I’m being rude I’m just have a lot to say! ) also can y’all allow users to see how many likes they get in there snaps on spotlight ?",willie and the hamsters

But then came the 3D avatar that you can put in a pose that’s behind ur profile. Huge mistake, huge turn off. Did not like it, it made my bitmoji look ugly and I now had to make sure my outfits looked good on my 3D avatar. Thennnnnnn y’all added the 3D friend bitmoji making everyone’s little profile 3D. Was sooooo close to deleting snap after this update. Like who thought this looked good. My bitmoji was so cute and now she looks like a model for a Steam game. None of my friends liked the update either. The 2Ds were super cute but someone at Snapchat’s HQ had a terrible idea. I’m assuming y’all r updating to give snap something new and dif so it stays relevant but I’m telling u it was perfect just the way it was before. Now y’all keep adding all this random junk like hiding the subscriptions and putting a lil bar where the send a chat is when I open a snap. Like I’m begging plsssss stop updating snap. Nobody likes it and soon it’ll get so bad it won’t be an app on anyones phone anymore. Thank you.",IWRITEREVIRWS
Snapchat,2022-09-22 23:29:54,Everyone is getting ban for no reason.,1,"I have had Snapchat for YEARS. 7+ years at this point. I don’t post much to my story the past few years because a lot of people in my life, and people I know online are getting ban for absolutely no reason. Snapchat support will not help you, you either get an automated response, or NOTHING at all. Real disappointed. I personally have a lot of photos in Snapchat that mean a lot to me, and I would be devastated if they were gone. I know a lot of people feel the same way, yet the photos are GONE. Nothing you can do about it. You can get a new phone and make a new account, but they’ll ban that account too. Snapchat actually device bans people. So if you even login to any Snapchat account on a phone that has been device ban, the account is immediately suspended. It’s even gotten to the point where they will ban your IP address. You can get ban for sm0king w33d in a legal state, but dr1nking alcohol is totally fine 🙄 Snapchat has become an absolute joke over the years. Not to mention the lawsuit in illinois over the issues Snapchat has had with peoples biometric data ☺️ Time to back up all your memories to be safe. Get ahold of yourself Snapchat.

getting lately, I keep getting kicked out and when I go back into the app, everyone and all my friends I have added their profile disappears and it says I don’t have them added when I do, and it’s not letting me text them. Also when I try to post a story it kicks me out and it fails, and that’s not even it, when I take a photo and I try to save it, it fails and says “You can’t save this” or something like that, please fix this and No it’s not my wifi because I’ve checked multiple times and my wifi is great, it’s the app. It use to be 5 stars but I’m gonna have to give it 3 stars now because this bug is really annoying and it’s getting on my nerves, if it keeps happening then I’m putting 1 star.

They always temporarily disable people from using their accounts. This happened to me 2 days ago when i was going to check my snaps and out of a sudden, i was temporarily banned. I searched up on the website how long it takes to not be banned and it told me for 24 hours (1 day). So i decided to wait for a day. The next day it tells me the same thing. Now this is a problem. I ask everyone who has snapchat to help me but it doesnt work. So i decide to shut down my phone. Doesnt work. Delete the app. Still doesnt work. So i just guess its a problem in the server and wait another day. The next day I try it again and it still tells me the same thing. I cant even make another account. So now Im writing this review because I cant always use someone elses phone for snapchat because I dont see everyone every single day and people wont always let me use their phones.

This app was the only way to connect with friends and I don’t have their contact or anything like that then I realized I got hacked I was stupid for letting that go right under my nose. but i wish I could get more help with trying to change my password easier instead of using my email address instead because of this I can’t recover my account. Sorry I just wish it would be easier to get my account back and these hackers to be delt with. Also reinstalling the app for my iPhone is not even a click away it’s doing all these steps. And the snap support thing doesn’t even work it’s a “diy” and I can’t recover something that was a big piece in my life this app needs to care more for its users AND supporters they can’t just ignore them also they shouldn’t allow people to have 100+ accounts and things it should only be 10 due to this some people don’t even like the app and they just need to be more helpful with their users!,CVIL3Y

Snapchat,2022-12-15 02:59:24,PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD BITMOJIS 😭,5,"Look I live laugh love Snapchat, but I absolutely cannot stand the new bitmojis. I understand that they were worked on a lot and that a lot of time and thought went into them. But please take me back to the 2D simple and cute ones. The new ones look so chunky and weird. My avatars curly hair just looks straight up matted, and her “baggy” clothes are stuck to her 3D body. The forehead looks like a billboard too- the 3D honestly looks so weird and it makes my brain hurt if I stare at them too long. I’m sorry but they’re actually scary. I know I’m not going to do anything to change it, because I obviously just insulted you and your choice in bitmoji design, not to mention I’m just one user out of millions. Plus the fact that you’re literally making billions of dollars a year, and one minor detail such as avatars won’t change much.

Snapchat,2023-03-20 11:17:48,Why I’m not a fan of Snapchat,1,"There are just too many ads. When I watch my friends stories, there is an ad after every friend. When I very occasionally scroll through the generalized feed, I’m forced to watch almost an equal amount of ads to content. As for the content, it’s really bad in my opinion too. Like it’s stupid and irrelevant content. The content also seems to be really clickbait-style and also follows the part1/part2 style of content.

The app does have some interesting features like being able to track friends, keep in touch with friends in a unique way, take good pictures, and use funky filters, but I don’t think any of it is worth it. First off the tracking really isn’t that good since it has offered me nothing but problems wi tbh my friends in the past, I can keep in touch with my friends the same way in Instagram without 100 ads at a time, I can download other apps to take good pictures, and half the filters are once again ads. 

The app has not been the most enjoyable to have downloaded. It takes up a bunch of space on my phone and if it weren’t for like 3 good friends I had on the app, then I would have deleted it.",tmandar

Snapchat,2022-09-16 21:06:46,Too many glitches,1,"The most annoying thing is the fact that every time you are sending a voice message, if you don’t keep clicking the screen to prevent it from blacking out, you will lose your voice recording. Every time the light fades from your phone, the voice clip you’re currently recording is completely lost even if it was 5 min long. Countless times I have given up trying to record something because of it. Been going on for years and I’m surprised Snapchat doesn’t even care to fix the issue. Also, when you upload several posts, many times it stops uploading the rest of your story and you lose the entire story. Imagine being an influencer and all your snaps get lost because it won’t upload and it won’t let you save them either. Just says “uploading 0%” for each snap that it didn’t feel like uploading and you will never ever get them back if you hadn’t saved them prior. Who has the space to save each snap story before posting it in case stupid Snapchat doesn’t upload them? How y’all not addressing these issues but keep finding other stupid meaningless “upgrades” that don’t even make a difference.",savePalestine-1
Snapchat,2022-11-26 11:00:11,Keeps going downhill,2,"Snapchat is one of the main ways I communicate with the people close to me. I do love the basic features they offer: sending photos to friends, filters, best friends list , stories, etc.  although within the past couple years it seems like every new update is just unnecessary. The only one have actually enjoyed is the front facing flash selection. But imo there’s no need for maps or a discover page, spotlight page of people I don’t even know, and seriously why did they make exporting photos and videos so much harder now? Pleaseee make it simpler. For the past few months I’ve had to click edit, share/export, then save to camera roll. It just shouldn’t be under edit, why did we take away the export button on the first screen showing the photo. Another request I have is to make the subscriptions and discover page smaller or further down and have the friends stories larger because that’s who we’re actually in the app for. Love you Snapchat, but you don’t have to be every other trending app out there. Stick to the roots and they will reap you plenty.",A user for 5+ years
Snapchat,2022-09-05 02:15:55,Snapchat is a dying app anyway,1,"I had a whole review typed and ready to go but it lagged and deleted everything I wrote. A current trend the app is doing since they can’t admit to their foolish mistakes. This app does not care about you but would rather kick you off due to a new update. This past week thousands of users were permanently blocked off Snapchat. All users explaining how they did nothing wrong and everything is gone as well their friends. I’m going to cut to the chase. Tiktok is a great app to call people out and spread awareness. Two good things, Snapchat is on tiktok and most people have tiktok. So what I'm saying is everyone who got booted needs to make a video stating their case of what happened to them and use the hashtag #snapchatban in the description as well as tagging Snapchat. With enough posts there is bound to be one that goes viral therefore making the hashtag viral. With thousands of people who are angry, Snapchat will have to respond or else they face being cancelled. Which honestly would be a good thing because another new and improved can take over and run Snapchat into the ground. Snap is growing more and more toxic, let us end this stupid app!",lachniet
Snapchat,2022-12-31 05:21:54,What I think should be included in next update,4,"First off I want to say… I love using Snapchat! I like the fact that we can take pictures & make videos while saving it to our memories instead of our actual camera roll. Not only that but it notifies us about events that happened on specific dates too!  I also like that it notifies you when a fiend is texting that way you can reply immediately. Who can’t forget the pretty cool filters of course :) I do think that a feature where we can “airdrop” memories to someone near by or just to a person you select would be cool. Instead of it going on our phone camera roll it would instead go into one’s Snapchat memories! I think this would be an awesome update because there’s people out there who #1 have 2 accounts such as me, and would like to transfer memories to the other account. And #2 there’s people like me who don’t have enough iCloud storage or storage at all to save all snap memories to the phone.",brisian
Snapchat,2022-10-25 23:22:43,Can’t believe it.,1,"I loved this app like many of you for years. I got this app when I was in 5th grade. Like everyone else in this world this app is how everyone on the planet communicates. Nobody uses text messages anymore. This is the app used to communicate. In fact, if you don’t have it people look at you as if you’re an alien of some sort. Everyone from young to old has this app nowadays. But where it goes wrong is with the permanent bans. I have never ever posted anything bad or illegal in my entire life. Not once. I posted CBD which is totally legal. And it wasn’t even me selling the CBD or anything like that. And I was permanently banned. Without warnings or strikes or anything. My entire account that had my entire life on it. Pictures. People I’ve known forever. Gone. Without cause or explanation. No support team to help me. Nobody to talk to. No appeal to be made. It’s unfair that people can post nude pictures of themselves. Or pictures of their body and not have anything happen. Or post illegal substances that they’re selling and not get into trouble. But me, with a clean slate. Never had a strike. Never did anything wrong on the app in my life gets banned. Fix it. Please Snapchat.",INSTAGRAM HQ TRASH
Snapchat,2022-08-30 01:36:22,Snapchat😂😟,3,"i like snapchat alot and how i can communicate with my family and friends, its super cool how you can snap back and forth plus doing streaks. Something also i really like about snap is posting on your stories so you can snap about yourself and making new friends and what you do in your daily life. There are a couple things that i dont like about snapchat is how there are these predators on there looking for children to do nudes and bad things on the internet and i like how you can report the photos and chats its just i really want the kids and teens on snap to be careful and talk to the people you know cause some people arent what you think. There is another thing i wanted to mention that i dont like is when you want to post a vid in your story but the time limit is only 1 minute. I think the limit should be around 3-5 minutes because some people like to post tiktoks on their story and tiktoks can be longer than a minute sometimes so its very tricky to add something like that. For whoever is watching this. BE CAREFULL!!🥰🫵",peyton🤭🫶
Snapchat,2022-08-26 23:49:29,Pros and cons,5,Are use Snapchat more than any other app however I am a teenager for parents considering downloading there are a lot of pluses you can talk to your friend safely you can send cool pictures it’s a fun app however anyone can add your kids they can innocently add them your location can be seen if turned on some of the videos on Snapchat are very inappropriate and you have access to a lot of things I would say the age limit does not matter it’s the kid a 12-year-old kid that’s mature and knows not to do dumb things can for sure have this app but a nine-year-old who doesn’t know what turn location on to everyone or post publicly so that any person on the world can see you they should not have this app you should monitor your kids on Snapchat because it is a very fun and helpful app especially for teenagers but for some kids I would say it’s very inappropriate and not the best app to download stay safe!!,😕😉🤓🥳🙃😒
Snapchat,2022-09-29 20:18:20,Love/Hate Relationship,5,"Snapchat is an app ive used for the past almost 6 years. throughout these past years the app has been great and convenient for me. it has allowed me to meet some of the greatest people in my life right now. however i do have a love/hate relationship with snapchat. over the time span ive had the app its had its moments where it can be a bit bugged. some of the updates werent the greatest but at the end of the day the app is excellent. i definitely recommend using snapchat to anyone who hasnt. and to all of the negative comments, stop getting upset over little things and ranting about things that make no sense. the app is made to communicate with others and as with anything else there will be problems every now and then. anyways thank you snapchat for the great people youve brought into my life and all the good times. i wouldnt be where i am now without this app.",Corrupt Cosmo
Snapchat,2023-03-06 14:01:33,snapchat is getting worse.,3,"see I’ve been using this app since around 2018. A LOT and when I say “a lot” I mean a lot has changed on this app. it’s lowkey kinda bad though. like the most recent updates are bad, like 3d avatars? snapchat premium? leave the chat button right by the avatar? etc. I’m sorry but I really do not like these updates. I feel like every time Snapchat has an update it’s a bad update. and I know most people won’t agree with me but I feel like snapchat just needs to take it slow and not do multiple updates at once. and all these bots of sugar mommies/daddies, porn stars, people who ask for your cash app to give you money but they don’t do it, etc. but those are the main ones. I don’t understand why snapchat doesn’t take action to this, locking, deleting, logging people out, etc; on people who didn’t do anything, when they should be doing this on bots. other than that I don’t really have other problems w this app, I just think yall should take it slow with the updates. so goodbye",dantdm lover 59
Snapchat,2022-12-05 20:16:59,Lack of support and morals in Snapchat team,1,"I have used Snapchat for years and lately I have noticed a lot of changes and allowance of promotion of porn and false information. Recently I have had an account banned and I had requested a consumer review of the account but Snapchat lacks the ability to stay in touch with its consumers. I also believe Snapchat allows the promotion of “private content” I thought this app was also for children? It’s very easy to access explicit content on snapchat without having to request to follow anyone or subscribe. Another one is sex bots. In my experience in snapchat I have blocked and reported many accounts that have deemed as sexual predators, these accounts still exist and it seems snapchat lacks the discipline to take care of these issues. I know another user name that has its data stolen from snapchat and when a email was sent to the support team about this issue they insistent on keeping the compromised data. This user name was wrongfully banned from snapchat. I do not recommend this app for any adolescent or even adult as they will compromise your data and likely sell it to the dark web.",fhjfjsjf
Snapchat,2023-03-18 18:36:35,compromising autoimmune progress.,1,"I’ve reached out to snap support 4 times now in a matter of 8 days. my app is not allowing me to login to any account due to “temporarily disabling from failed attempts or possible suspicious activity” absolutely ZERO “suspicious” activity and I did not have failed attempts. I can log into my snap on any other phone, but not mine??? So it’s not my account just the app. This is an actual health concern at this point because I use snap to track the progress of my health, including pictures of skin flare ups I use to show my doctor. Without this I am literally screwed on all of my progress and this WILL take a MAJOR toll on my health!!!! Please, without some generic response asking me to “reach out to support” WHEN I HAVE MULTIPLE TIMES- I would actually like something done about this. I’ve tried deleting and redownload, doesn’t work. Again it’s not my account, my account has never even had warnings of any kind. I’ve used snap for 8 years literally. It is my favorite app and the only app I use to communicate with most people in my life. Please fix this for me please, you can’t expect people to buy new phones….",Mmmmmmoooooommmmoo
Snapchat,2022-12-08 20:45:19,Snapchat,5,"Snapchat is a great way to communicate with your friends and family. You can send videos and pictures with out taking up storage. You can also text with out taking any storage up. You can also put on funny and cute filters. Another thing is you have your own story and you can make private stories. I know I am not specific on the stories but download it to figure it out. You can also post to a spotlight and if you go onto spotlight you can watch different funny videos and stuff like that. Spotlight is kinda light a TikTok. One thing I recommend on Snapchat is turn of you location! There is a thing where you can see your friends location and that is the only thing that is bad about Snapchat. Not great for kids because of the location, but you can have your own opinion. Download Snapchat right now and enjoy. ps: trust me, you work regret it.",yahh10
Snapchat,2022-08-23 12:04:13,Been a member of this app since it started,4,"I have always been apart of snapchat since they started and by far it has come a long way, only thing I wish they could do is when they show you memories from a year ago on this day. Now I save so many snaps to the point where I’m running out of space and sometimes I see memories I want deleted like videos I didn’t mean to save but there’s no way to delete your memories it says it will take it away from the story but keep in my memories when you delete like snapchat do you think I want to scroll and try and figure out when I recorded this video just to delete it. I would have so much more storage cleared if I could just delete videos permanently from the memories section. I don’t understand why that’s not an option especially for people who are social media influencers like I have way to many videos saved to try and scroll through it just to delete the memory.",xx.ultraviolet

I gave up on all other social media apps because of the ads flooding feeds and floods of posts that weren’t relevant (or echo chamber - overly relevant). I use this app to share quick little moments of my daily life with my family and people I am closest to. I like that I can swipe to the larger feed to keep up with the basic social-content trends, see the latest dances etc. but love how that is not the main focus and just an option to browse through. I like that there isn’t some long history and years of content that other people can scroll through. It’s great how it all just goes away! So much less pressure to take the perfect photo than other apps, and i don’t mind sharing just silly daily things. Filters used to be better but now there are too many choices.",Lib1234xyz

Doesnt matter i would keep getting messages that i violated terms and would have not one single story posted in my app. I had some men report actually me as posting these things or bc i woudlnt follow thru w what they paid a hacker for. I messaged snapchat about this and worrying about being blocked. I was also getting reported for posting in certain stances or even for just wearing a bikini as a fat girl. Snapchat can allow KIM KARDASHIAN to post their bare bikini photos as profit but if i do it i am violating terms sexualizing snapchat? I tried to talk to them via app and via twitter. It  is not a real person ever dealing w this app. My phone its self has been banned so i cannot even remake a new account. Its crazy to me how we MADE THIS APP FAMOUS and its ads and money from the public keep them going but they can control what we say and what we post.

Snapchat,2023-02-27 03:37:24,horrific support,1,"first and foremost, the ‘support’ team is just awful. i had to send SEVERAL emails about someone using my email and they all but refused to do something until i raised a huge fuss about privacy issues. then, i needed to change the phone number associated with my account as my number was going to be changed but the app just wouldn’t let me. tried to reach support then and almost the exact same response but with zero results and ultimately had to delete the entire account because they straight up told me they wouldn’t do anything and couldn’t help. 5+ years worth of memories having to be transferred to a google drive and having to go through my entire contact list to tell them to add my new account. they followed that support request up with saying they were not going to be responding to any further emails from me about the issue. 

tldr; if you ever plan on changing your phone number or just generally needing support on bugs, issues, and privacy problems with someone else using your email address without your permission, do not expect to get any help whatsoever.",Wolfett

But just recently I was temporarily disable for logging in and out of my snap because I was helping my friend do her streaks while her phone was broken and apparently that was “suspicious activity” and I’m now temporarily disabling for using it on my phone. It’s been almost a week and I’ve contacted Snapchat 2 times and I still have to reply. I’ve tried everything that they say in there little articles but non of it works. I was told I should be able to get back in after 24-48 hours. But yet it’s been almost a week and no luck. Apparently this is a bug that has been needed to be fixed for awhile now and they still haven’t. I’m very upset that I’m still not able to get in to my account on my phone. I think it’s dumb how they haven’t had this bug fixed when it’s happened for years and how they don’t reply when needed assistance.",nikie 4567893425
Snapchat,2022-09-15 01:21:53,SNAPCHAT IS GREAT!!!!,5,"So luv Snapchat so so so so much! Out of all the apps I have gotten, best by one by far! Snapchat is totally a safe and non toxic place if you use it the right way. A lot of parents say no to Snapchat for kids under 13, but I have some tips to help change your mind. 1. If your worried about snap map, one ANWSER. Ghost mode. It completely turns off your location for everyone! Super helpful for your child’s safety. 2. Snapping friends. If your worried about your child sending pictures to random people, you can simply ignore friend request you don’t know, and promise to only snap your friends! 3. Last thing, I promise. Not looking at spotlight page, or other stories. That is the only thing that could be toxic or appropriate thing on this social app. Overall, this app has no many highs, and very little lows! Hopefully this was very helpful, download Snapchat today!",Emliy Grey

Snapchat,2022-10-30 12:00:00,5 years of memories lost,1,"I’ve had Snapchat since 2017, I woke up one day and it said my account was deactivated so I tried to log back in but it said it was permanently locked, my friends texted me on another app to ask me if I blocked them but I didn’t. I tried making a new account but it kept on being glitchy and saying “something went wrong try again later” so I swiped out of the app and clicked it again and it look me back to the log in/sign up screen, so I tried to log back into my new account I just made but it said “account not found,” I found out that once your account is permanently locked, you can’t make a new account on that device. I still like Snapchat and still use it on my old phone but it’s becoming a hassle, Snapchat needs to fix this and find a way to get my account back because I had 5 years of memories on that, from 4th grade to 10th, I had memories of my friends and family that I will never get back, Snapchat is stupid and I cannot believe this happened to me in just one night and now all my memories from the past 5 years are gone.",😐🍪
Snapchat,2022-11-23 00:55:08,Dear Snapchat,5,"Dear Snapchat, Can you make the app available where you can watch snap stories on the Apple watch as well as be able to reply to snap messages on the Apple watch? It would be very helpful. Another suggestion I have for Snapchat that would be to make the DM messaging experience a little more user-friendly by adding the Edit message button in DMs. Can we be honest here? Nobody is perfect by any means and it can be pretty embarrassing to accidently send someone the wrong word or message to the wrong person or whoever your chatting with and to correct the mistake you have to send a whole new message. Wouldn't it be easier for everyone if you could edit and fix the error in the first place with the original message? Think about it for a minute; how do you personally feel when this type of thing happens to you?",HappyGirl2016

Everytime I go on to watch my memories it crashes and kicks me off the entire app. Anytime I go to see the pics I took on Snapchat or any videos , it crashes as soon as I start watching ir viewing them. When I wana post a video from tiktok it crashes and kick me off the entire app. Only good thing so far that has been happening is I can still Snapchat and send selfies to people but anything and everything else just keeps crashing!! I have already made several “bug reports” on the app it’s self, and went to the “app is crashing” option when I sent the report and I made my comments and I’ve done this at least 6 times already.

I proceeded to search for hours on how to contact Snapchat but to my avail a company as large as this one does have have good solid communication centers to deal with issues when they arise for its users, and that saddens me. What saddens me more is I reached out over twitter and absolutely nothing, I had photos saved to my memories from family & friends that have passed or I no longer have contact with.

It transports us to a land of possibilities where you are able to visualize your best self and ideal outcomes because seeing is believing as thinking and learning get us to the next level because reality begins in the mind before we manifest it into reality and snap chat is the ultimate catalyst and change maker for a better brighter and more fulfilling and meaningful future in this present  moment at the bottom of your finger tips; now isn’t that lovely and simply amazing.

Secondly I think we should be able to pin more than 3 people maybe like 5 people or 6 because I have a lot of people I want to pin and can’t.

Snapchat,2023-01-11 22:43:36,Snapchat updates ✨,4,"I love Snapchat, it’s one of my main communication/social media devices I use. I don’t however love how the updates continue to add things on the screens where they start to cover the actual snaps themselves. 
The most recent update, every snap I get now it has a thick gray box on the bottom for “replying a message” to the snapper that sent the snap, but it’s quite annoying when you have a big box covering the bottom of the screen. This particular comment box used to be transparent and you could still see the snaps behind the box. But it just seems like more things get added to the screens every update, and idk if anyone else feels this way or not, but I find it kind of annoying. There is already a way to comment to someone, or reply, or snap. You don’t need a whole other box on top of someone’s snap picture/video to remind you to comment or reply..",KayJacy

Every email I have sent about my concerns was immediately followed up with an automated email about how I cannot get my account back although that’s not what I was emailing about in the first place. With college coming around the corner I will suffer immensely due to the fact that Snapchat is the main form of communication on any college campus. I hope that Team Snapchat sees this and follows up with an email and an expiration for why my account was permanently locked without a warning or a temporary lock first. I am now stuck with no Snapchat and no chance to get a new Snapchat. I’m very disappointed in how the support system is set up, it needs a change.

I did all my research on what may help it and nothing seemed to work. Which made me have to email them and submit a report but they couldn’t do anything about it. I have not violated any of the Snapchat guidelines and I did not have that many failed attempts to log in. I’ve seen the only solution for me is to make a new iCloud account or get a new phone which I think is ridiculously stupid and expensive on my part. Why get a whole new phone just because Snapchat doesn’t wanna properly explain to me what I can do to help me. I don’t understand why this happened and I uninstalled everything that may be a “third-party app” or may cause “suspicious activity” and nothing at all has helped me get my account back on to my phone. And it’s only my phone since when I use my friends phone’s to log in to my account I could log in perfectly fine but when it came to my phone it didn’t work.,Jojo's reference

Snapchat,2022-10-07 19:29:09,Love this app but it’s got some issues,3,"I’ve used Snapchat for many years, since the launch of stories. Its been my go to choice for social media, but there are some gripes I have that I’ve encountered over the years.
Firstly, the ads/news. I feel like Snapchat would benefit greatly from having less ads between my friend’s stories. I understand that this app has to be monetized to keep the company afloat, but the frequency they come up is kinda ridiculous. Also, snap news is a mess and I’m not really a big fan of that feature.
My second real gripe is recent. The ring flash has become the default flash on my front facing camera. It just doesn’t perform as well as the original flash, and the fact that I now have to click out of it whenever I want to take a picture using the old school flash is kinda frustrating and makes it take longer for me to send my snaps. Please just put the default flash back where it belongs :(",The Mitchy
Snapchat,2023-03-15 13:15:37,Scamming their users,1,I bought the Year subscription for premium features and suddenly my account is deleted. No warning. I’ve seen other people’s accounts get removed and it says harassment/bullying terms” “sexual content terms” “hacking/third party app terms” etc.  Like it specified why the account was removed. Mine just said “community terms.” I was told my account is only temporarily disabled and I can unlock it. Tried unlocking and still couldn’t log in. Was told I need to log in within 30 days or my account will be permanently disabled. I tried unlocking and logging in every day and then it just told me the account doesn’t exist anymore now that I’m past 30days. I’ve lost important photos and messages from my husband. I’ve lost sentimental things I had saved from a friend that was killed recently. AND I sat at the airport for SEVEN HOURS because snapchat was how I communicated with my ride from the airport. I’ve sent a total of 6 emails over the past month with zero reply. DO NOT BUY their upgrade. They will take your money and delete your account.,Kiera Wilmot
Snapchat,2023-01-07 05:38:26,Fake support team! Snapchat doesn’t care about their users,1,"So my account was removed off of Snapchat because a family member pulled a prank on me and used my phone to post something on my private story on Snapchat. Once I got my phone back and went onto Snapchat my account had been terminated because of the post. My ability to use Snapchat as a whole was disabled as well.

When I went to the “customer support team” it took 2 days and about 6 emails for them to finally get back to me. But don’t be fooled by the fake names they use, Snapchat’s “support team” are just automated robot replies. They did absolutely nothing to restore my account or provide any help at all on this issue.

This is super dissapointing especially with an app as big as Snapchat, you’d think that they’d care about a user’s experience when using the app, but nope. I need Snapchat to communicate with schoolmates, certain coworkers, and I had years of memories on there that are now completely gone just because Snapchat is too lazy to drop a penny on customer support.",Evan Murch
Snapchat,2022-11-29 04:00:22,WORST APP EVER,1,Eventually snapchat will screw you over. I never thought it would happen to me but it did. There are many cases I looked into where Snapchat would unexpectedly without warning delete accounts and ban the device from logging in or even making a new account. That happened to me. I was unexpectedly logged out with the note that my account was permanently gone. I tried logging into my spare accounts and it would tell me they were locked too. It won’t let me access my spare accounts or even allow me to make another. It would tell me that I have no connection when I do. I have full bars on wifi and service and even moved locations to see if that would change anything. Everything else works on my phone but Snapchat wants nothing to do it. It will happen to everyone eventually and there is nothing anyone can do about it because Snapchat support doesn’t want to help anyone with any problem. They just give you suggestions and not even an option to speak to anyone via email or over the phone.,MusictrialReviewer
Snapchat,2022-10-02 14:07:11,Infuriated,1,I have had snapchat since 2014. A few months back my account was hacked and the hacker posted something that violated community guidelines. I’ve tried everything to get it back but somehow the most popular social media messaging app in the world doesn’t have a PHONE NUMBER TO CALL🤦‍♂️I’ve tried emailing I’ve tried using their support page and it’s always the same thing. I’m told that I will not be able to get my account back for so and so long. I have lost 8 YEARS worth of memories I used this app RELIGIOUSLY. First thing I did when I woke up was check my Snapchat. All I want at this point is the ability to create a new account I’ve come to terms with the fact that I’ll never get those 8 YEARS of memories back but all I have to say is if you have never had snapchat DONT GET IT. The customer support is non existent and it’s just as easy for someone to hack your account as it was mine and boom all those memories and everything go right down the drain. I used to love this app but I don’t foresee the device ban being lifted so yeah. Stay away.,aifoeoekwwnehes
Snapchat,2022-08-30 12:24:09,Surprising right?,5,"It’s Snapchat, what’s not to like. You send pictures or receive pictures from whoever you want. It’s free. It’s got it’s own Snapchat version of TikTok. You can see peoples stories. You can even text!!!! Although beware… a lot of predators lurk in the deep dark caves of unexplored quickadds. Other than that I would say it’s all around great. Well, one more issue I face is not being able to pin anyone now unless I pay for premium. Snapchat needs to stay simple and easy. That’s why we liked it to begin with. I understand you need micro transactions but you could make them another way ex: certain clothing for bitmoji costs money, making certain filters cost money etc. but you don’t gotta make the pin cost hella money. All in all I’m still satisfied with the app, and have minimal complaints",genuine rates by psycho🐀🐕🤏
Snapchat,2023-02-08 17:04:14,The Whole Idea is cool :),5,"I like Snapchat because random people can’t view your story or posts if you don’t allow them to be your friend. The filters are hilarious and super fun to use, it’s really quick to use since my camera keeps acting up. Another thing is if you have an online friend who has your Snapchat, and if you exchange pictures, you can tell if it’s real or stolen. Like if it reads “from camera roll” you can tell it wasn’t just taken. So that is one good way to tell if they are really who they are, not to mention you can see their stories and bitmoji anyway. Correct me if I’m wrong about the online friend thing, so I don’t trick people through a fake sense of safety. That’s just what I think. Over all, I like Snapchat a lot and my friends respond to me more with the app.

Thanks!",CarryOnRoadkill
Snapchat,2022-12-15 03:46:06,"It’s very good, but…",3,"I think the app is AMAZING in general. On this app you are able to contact your friends, family, significant others very easily. Not only can you message them, but you can call, send photos, videos, very quickly. You can also have this score with the people you know called a snap streak, which I think is very awesome, but there is just one downside that I think is not right. I noticed from going to one of my friends profiles, we have saved many photo, videos, and some chat attachments, but there’s also something else I noticed. There wasn’t a voice message save section, the voice message feature is very cool and I love it and there are many memories in those types of messages. I don’t like scrolling through chats, because it takes a long time. It also wastes time to scroll so long. So I really hope that Snapchat will eventually come up with a voice chat save section feature.",Plzzzzzzxz

It’s really fun to watch all of the stories and everything. One thing I don’t like is when the snap calls give out so much, that’s really annoying along with the ads but that’s for a different time. Me and my boyfriend are going long distance soon and we are trying to get used to sleeping on call and calling more in general but we can’t do that very well when the calls keep giving out and it’s truly annoying, our internet is fine and it goes for hours but sometimes during the day it gives out but it’s mainly at night, it’ll just keep giving out and it’s super irritating.",minooe

Snapchat,2023-03-31 19:47:34,Hackers…,3,Most recently iv lost my account same with So many people!! Some person or people have been asking for phone numbers. The people have used other accounts to lore “their friends” into this. Personally this is a hazard to many people with there eyes only and what not and its rough knowing someone on snap or more than one person is taking accounts slowly without anyone knowing till a few hours later. If theres some way to fix this issue please do because iv had 3 friends fall for this on My account that got hacked and I feel terrible. Also according to my friends the hacker is posting stuff on my story and it shows the inside of my house. Then again i had photos very few of where i usually snap people. So they aren't in my house. But Everyone needs to be careful and its been happening since Christmas from what I heard. And the people have taken So many i feel to many accounts.,softball/speeder
Snapchat,2023-01-19 03:37:27,Gone completely downhill,1,"Snapchat used to be one of the best messaging apps, but now it’s just become entirely obnoxious to use. They keep adding random features that NO ONE actually wanted or likes, which has made Snapchat so annoying to use. Why would they make it so it automatically opens someone’s story if you open the “stories” page??? I get you can swipe instead but honestly what was the point of that? It’s annoying to open up some random person’s story when I didn’t want it to. Not to mention, now it doesn't actually hide the muted stories. They still pop up like normal. Also, no matter HOW MANY TIMES I press “stop seeing this ad” on an ad I’ve gotten maybe 2,478 times now, IT KEEPS POPPING UP!!! Ads in general have gotten out of hand on Snapchat, but there is one specific ad for an app I have NO interest in and DO NOT WANT but they keep pushing it on me. I keep reporting it. I keep getting it. I don’t recommend snapchat to anyone anymore. It’s not enjoyable or easy to use, just a hassle and more of a bother than it’s worth.",Victoria Starr
Snapchat,2022-10-07 20:22:41,Ugh,2,"Every update brings some annoying new feature to keep you watching as many ads and stories as possible. 

There is now an ad between every single friend story and between every 2-3 posts on subscriber stories. It's SO frustrating. The ads are also usually glitchy and freeze on my screen, presumably to force me to watch more of them. Snapchat also took away the story progress bar, so I can't close a story on its last page to skip the ad (I assume that's why they took it away.) 

I miss ""discover"" being on a separate page. Back when it was a separate page I completely ignored it. I wasn't delighted when it was combined with friend stories, but at least subscribed stories were clearly separated from random discover stories. Now, they're all pooled in together and it's awful.  I'm only subscribed to like 2 people and don't really care what the rest are doing. I don't want it to swipe down to the next stranger's story and start playing it for me.",xXxXXxJO..xXxXx
Snapchat,2022-09-07 00:56:22,🥲,1,"Been using snap for almost a decade now, before they were shoving ads with political agendas down your throat. Now, almost everything is followed by an ad. When they first rolled them out, it’d be one or two here and there, no bother. Now? You can’t even make it through a story without at least 4+ ads popping up, and they got smart and made them mandatory to watch. Waste of a great app, honestly. If you’re using it to snap people it’s not as bad, but if you try to access other content, it’s a nightmare. Plus their ads are so obviously politically driven it’s not even funny. And if you’re the person saying “they’re not politically driven ads”, you’re probably the person those ads are for. I wish they’d stop with the mandatory ad stuff, and I also wish they’d stop shoving the same ads with different names down my throat despite me reporting them as harassing and irrelevant to me. Oh well, though. Social media itself is going down the toilet, might as well throw this one into the mix too. It was bound to happen at some point.",Reza Rahnama1
Snapchat,2022-08-31 06:16:44,I love it,5,Snapchat is an amazing way to talk to your friends and family and take silly photos I love Snapchat so much Snapchat also has a thing Snapchat spotlight Snapchat spotlight doesn’t rot your brain like Tik Tok and is less addictive you can like the videos that you like and then it will go into your profile you can also share what you’re doing to the world in Snapchat spotlight. In Snapchat you can post what you’re doing to your friends and family with your story and take a picture in a story in all of your friends and family can see it but also if you don’t want someone see you can you can do a private story Snapchat is it safe way to always have fun also you can send your location family and friends safely that’s what I love about Snapchat!!!!!,remove atleast some ads

I’ve started to get really frustrated with this error because my avatar needs fixing. Ive looking at friends avatar and they’ve tried to see what is wrong but they do not know.

I’ve enjoyed the app for so many years. The memories feature has been around since my son was one, he’s 9 now. I have years of memories of my child, friends, family & loved ones passed. I loved the app & used it more than any other social media. I got a new phone Saturday & was very disappointed that the first time contacting support in all these years they were utterly useless. I know the email on the account & they refuse to send a reset password or help verify the account any other way. Don’t expect to be listened to - let alone helped. I’ve gotten the same copy pasta message from bots every time I submit a support request. If you reply to the email it auto tells you that they’re ending correspondence. I just want to talk to a person & have a little empathy in the situation. Seeing how apple & Verizon has treated this vs snapchat shows the difference a good (human) support makes.",emorysherbert
Snapchat,2022-08-26 21:08:51,2 Star,2,I give this app a two star because they need to have a age verification of some sort before signing up it would also be helpful to see others ages. To many kids under 16 This app is used by lots of crooks and it shouldn’t! I like Snapchat but it seems to be going down hill. To many adds! Between story viewing! Also I would really like if this app didn’t show in chat that you “Screen recorded chat” or “took a screenshot” it’s none of there business and why should it? If your going to be hiding something or doing inappropriate stuff don’t type it all all. If the viewer doesn’t see it neither does the texted then both people won’t worry about anything and there will be no dispute. Also they should make a similar feature like onlyfans where if you were to take a picture/ScreenShot of a story private or not then it would black out the image so no one can view it accept the actual devise it’s on. That’s all other then that great app👍🏻,JACKTHESNEAKERKID
Snapchat,2022-11-10 18:36:42,Still can't delete or activate 2FA,1,"Extremely insecure. If you are willing to risk some stranger just signing into your account, having your name, birthday, phone number, and email address, because you made your account when you were a teen and wasn't smart enough to put in all fake info, then the app is fine. However if you're someone who actually likes security, you're screwed. Can't activate 2FA and haven't been able to for about a week now, can't delete my account either. At least I could finally change my password after a week of struggling! How great, if someone had broken into my account I wouldn't have been able to change my password to save it. Refusing to let people delete their accounts so you can have inflated numbers is ridiculous. Let people delete. I'm seriously this close to just trying to spam add people or flagging my own account so snapchat takes it down for me, since they clearly have the ability to delete accounts, they just won't let you do it yourself.",NonbinarLee

I've lost over six years of memories, not to mention messages and other important contacts. I like that it's safe but I hope there can be more help for the users in the future, when they lose access to this stuff. I've lost memories of people who have passed, that I'll never get back, and it just hurts my brain to know they're floating around but I can't get to them simply because I am locked out. Wish there was better customer service to get that back, as it might not sound so serious to the workers but these memories really are priceless and as someone with memory issues, this is extremely frustrating.",brilliantbrunette447

The new ring flash is HORRENDOUS. The second I open up the camera I'm instantly blinded by the terrible ring like feature, not to mention how terrible the quality of photos look with it! I get it, yeah it's cool and trendy, but at least make an option in the settings where you can turn it off completely. I use the normal front flash feature and love it, and the quality is stellar on my 13 Pro. It doesn't automatically turn on when you decide you want to use flash, and it only flashes when you take the photo. I hate this update so much. Seriously Snapchat... fix this ASAP please.

I just lost years of pictures and memories, all of my friends; over practically nothing. Teens and young adults use this app; I’ve seen worse/more scandalous things on snapchats story feature thing than I’ve seen on stories actual people post. It’s unreasonable to permanently lock someone out over a single incident. At least implement a strike feature or something. What happened was this: I was asked by someone to shout out his acc on a private story so I did, an got permanently banned for it. At least review the account before deleting it. I had my life practically documented on that acc an really just lost it all. I can’t even make a new account either. I tried logging into an old account and it told me that account was locked too. I never post or text people from my backup acc, so developers just took it down just because it’s simply on the same phone. Fix your app please, like for real.",skeledex
Snapchat,2022-10-09 19:53:14,Cool but Chats (& Groups),3,"Most recent update at time of review.

Love the app. Hate how videos in chats send in 10 second increments. It wasn’t always like this like it started with some update. The individual increments isn’t really the issue like it’s weird, but hey at least if I want to cut out a certain part of the video I can delete the entire segment from the chat (would be better to just cut that part of the video, but ig you can only edit individual segments of memories also so whatever). The issue is that there isn’t an auto play between segments so the people you send videos to have to watch the video 10 seconds at a time. It’s annoying.

Would also be dope if the person that created a group had the option for more like admin/owner power over the group (e.g. ability to remove people from the group or the option/ability to not allow others to change the name)",is this one taken omg

They are just throwing more and more at you by the week it’s ridiculous. This app is going downhill. If this wasn’t the only way I could get ahold of some people I wouldn’t use it. It’s only an add generator and annoying. Can’t even take off the people I somehow turned on notifications for their stories and can’t turn it off, tried in the car for 5 minutes with full internet. Ok didn’t work, got home, on wifi still same thing. Just loads and loads. Unable to take off the 3 people I want off of their I don’t want anymore stupid notifications.

We have tried troubleshooting everything. We have tried contacting Snapchat support but they have done absolutely nothing to help. She lost everything for no reason. It is extremely frustrating and incredibly sad. No temporary lock, not even an explanation. What an absolute embarrassment of a company. She is not alone either. After researching any kind of solution to get her account back, we found countless people being permanently locked from their account for no reason daily. Unless Snapchat can fix this problem and get her and other unjustly locked people’s accounts back, I do not recommend using this app to store any kind of photos or videos or any kind of memory. You can legitimately lose everything randomly for no reason and no explanation at all. Snapchat fix this.",Spirit Of Battle
Snapchat,2022-10-14 17:43:08,My review on Snapchat,3,OK so I really do think that Snapchat is really good like I called the community but social media like for like 12 year olds and 11 year old to be on because all those sometimes you can get scams just tell your children if you let them on Snapchat not to add people back unless you know them and because you know things that you might not like might happen but you can call your friends and you know socialize with all your friends on the phone though so that way if they’re far away you can still call them and stuff but you know just it’s it’s amazing that you get to like send your friends pictures and stuff or like call them or text them or look at their location like say someone went missing and you wanted to find their location you could find a location on that I mean I’m sure there’s absolutely fine locations on but.,ctcybtcctun

The essential idea of Snapchat to converse through pictures and videos is just cool. 
I only have two complaints: 1. The app needs to stop with with updates where it changes its layout, it’s enough now. We don’t want anymore, in fact you can even go back like 3-4 updates. 2. I wish Snapchat would add a feature where you can still view your stores you posted and the viewers who saw it in like an archive thing like how you can do on Instagram.

You can make your own character and it’s just grate. Also  you can post things on your story which is grate! But there is one thing I think you can work on. The clothes… You are coming out with a lot more clothes, but your not supporting people enough. You need to get more cultures and things like that in the clothes, it’ll let people express them selfs more and just feel comfortable and complete.

Snapchat,2022-12-29 00:14:25,The Unskippable ads feel like they’re force feeding the liquid at the bottom of a trashcan,2,"The unskippable ads really disrupt user experience and make me blacklist the products and entertainment I see because I find them so annoying- to the point where I’ve unsubscribed from all the subscriptions I had and just watch that same content on Instagram or tiktok. They play after every fourth video and you can’t skip it for 6 seconds. They’re also not “personalized” at all, so Snapchat is basically holding you hostage for seven seconds and force feeding me the liquid at the bottom of a trashcan thinking it will make me buy the company’s bottled garbage water when I have absolutely no interest whatsoever, and am now even more likely to avoid the product. 
Everything else on the app is stellar and I wouldn’t change a thing but the advertising really shows how Snapchat would rather tank their user experience just for a quick buck.",Hannahsapeach
Snapchat,2022-12-20 15:09:55,Loved it but I ended up deleting it...,3,"I had Snapchat for only a year now, and I ended up deleting it because it was becoming more than just ""A place where you can snap and chat."" It was getting to where my mom said she would get into a lot of trouble for if someone (lets say Josie, my crush ❤️) sent me her left peach, and say that I saved it in chat or in my camera roll (which is something I never do, if someone I know is reading this,) then me and Josie's phones would be confiscated because, Josie sent that Snap, and I ended up not reporting it. Either way I still like the app but you can snap each other nasty stuff and then get in a lot of trouble for it in the future. Snapchat, if you want, you may modify your app and get people banned but I am not asking you to do it if you don't want to, it was just a suggestion if you want to do it in the future.

Snapchat,2022-08-26 04:19:26,Snapchat addiction!,5,I absolutely love Snapchat. It is an addiction. I use the app every single day several times throughout the day. It’s pretty much how I send my messages except for they’re funny and entertaining. I also tend to use Snapchat and record myself and make silly videos so when I am sad and upset I just go back and watch my videos. I laugh uncontrollable and I end up making myself happy again. Or at least content. They took my most favorite character away. But other than that I have streaks that last over a year. would have a couple more at a couple years but Snapchat didn’t think we snapped in time so I lost my streaks had to start over.😳😖😩😭 but I definitely give this app a five star plus..  Thanks Snapchat 💜😎,#Bitchface
Snapchat,2022-09-11 19:40:41,Snapchat,2,"I love Snapchat I always have and always will. I may be wrong but I never had a chance to actually write too Snapchat or review or for you guys to give me regarding the app. Instead I get an option of just a survey about some ad. I don’t know why my Bitmojis look weird now that’s just only one of the reasons why I never update my phone to avoid the errors that you guys put into Snapchat. I truly do miss the old Snapchat however I do like the new features but overall I’m not a big fan of it and the majority of my friends and I have stopped using Snapchat because of it. I will always remember snapchat I had it every since 2013 but I would appreciate it if it went back to what it was originally the notification type, bitmoji looks and what it’s being advertised should be edited as well as so many other things. I do like the app but it’s making me lose interest as time goes on

Snapchat,2022-09-12 03:38:56,LOVE IT. a few changes tho please?,4,"I LOVE IT SO SO SO MUCH it’s just a little laggy for me like if i send a lot of snaps my app freezes or crashes or takes very long to load also an issue with multisnap and shortcuts when i go to shortcuts some of the people i have on there dissapear and come back later

also when i looked at my friends list by clicking on my profile some of them dissapeared but i was still friends with them so it said i only have 5 friends when i have way more so that’s 2 bugs

another thing which a lot of people are asking for a really popular question is CAN YOU PLEASEEEE bring the old bitmoji back i loved the style more the new one is a little weird and also the old ones just prettier i like the stickers with them and stuff just way better please bring it back :) that’s it",daivya ares

Snapchat,2022-08-30 00:23:14,"Love the communication, hate the bias.",2,"Snapchat is a great app that allows you to connect with your friends and people you don’t even know. It allows you to get to know people better, share memories, and organize new ones. The thing I hate, absolutely despise about Snapchat is that the discover page is littered with clickbait and bias. Many posts have fake titles that either lead you to a post talking about someone or something that doesn’t even show in the story. Not to mention the political bias that is shown in many stories on the discover page. I’m not normally a political person and understand and relate to both sides views, but I see a lot of stories focused on these matters that isn’t helping anyone understand and only filling minds with biased information/blow out of proportion information. Regardless I love the app it’s just some of the content inside is annoying enough to not click on the app for the rest of the day.",GameReviewer😷😁

Snapchat,2022-10-07 11:25:06,Banned?,1,"So typically snap is one of if not my favorite app to use. It’s is so easy to add friends from school and work as well as allow so many creative options for creators and overall has developed into a great app.
However, my snap account was blocked or perma banned without further explanation. I hadn’t uploaded nor sent anything explicit nor offensive. So when I tried going on snap yesterday I was kicked out and doesn’t allow me to log in nor make another account. Since 2015, 6 years of memories, friends from home and else where have all been erased. With no way to contact them I just feel it’s unjust. 
I appreciate that snapchat takes safety of users strongly however, I hadn’t posed a threat. So overall, I just wish i could get an explanation or something cause it’s upsetting losing all those memories and snaps.
But other then this issue it’s a great app and I recommend anyone who wants an app for making friends and content for sharing between friends would love this app.",W0W_UR_C00L

Every time I try to change the pass it changes the pass for my current account instead. I don’t know why it does that but I’ve been trying to log back into the old account for like 2 years already. I put the user of the old pass, change password and finally when I put the old accounts user and put the password I changed it to it doesn’t work and the password I used to try to log back into my old account only works on my current account.

Snapchat,2022-10-17 05:01:03,Locked out of account.,1,"I have had my same snapchat account since the 7th grade I am now a senior in highschool. My whole life was on that account . Videos of my great grandma and my pets that have passed that I can’t get back , precious family photos with my siblings before they were adopted. My account was permanently locked and I believe it was because of a hacker. I had never even had my account be temporarily locked before so this seems like way to harsh of a punishment. I am deeply upset at how snapchat handles customer service I have been trying for nearly a week and can not get anything more than an automated response. I feel as though half of my life was just taken from me with no explanation. snapchat was how I stayed in contact with everyone around me and classmates for school work and projects. ik it seems silly to be so upset about losing a social media account but those memories meant everything to me. I can’t even make another account for school and work.",dtttywdug

Snapchat,2023-01-09 22:03:39,This is Great!,5,I love this app. It’s loads of fun except for the spammers & bots. A good addition to this app would be the when a person invites you to add them you could go see when they opened the account and if they’ve told you a little about themselves before you add them. Example: someone invites me to add them. I go check their profile and see the date they started their account and if it has little to no information then I’d know it’s a spammer. So I wouldn’t add them. This separates the people who just like to chat from the people that just want you to go chat somewhere else. I like snap and don’t want to chat elsewhere. They want to make sure I’m a real person and they are bots…. Still love the app tho. Just a suggestion.  Thank you.,Mongoose😎
Snapchat,2022-08-27 03:17:53,Updates,5,"Honestly I’ve been using Snapchat for so long. I’ve never really thought about how awesome the app really is until today it asked me to leave a review. Normally when an app asks me to leave a review I get unhappy because it’s interrupting whatever I’m doing, but today when it happened I actually sat and thought to myself “I should do it.” Through the years and the updates and even previous Snapchat accounts I’ve never had, Snapchat has never let me down. most of my best memories were captured through Snapchat and then posted to other social media‘s. Even looking back today I have more significant moments in my life saved in my Snapchat memories than I do in my actual camera roll. 10/10 app🏆🎉",Jaydalynn323

Snapchat,2022-08-20 19:32:10,Pointless Updates,3,"First of all, I don’t like that the app wants to store data about my face, hands, voice, etc… for “camera improvement with filters”. That’s completely unnecessary, especially since I use generic filters that just change the warmth (color) of the Snapchat. 

I also don’t like the 3D bitmoji. I want the last version back. The 3D looks goofy to me, but the updated bitmoji (not original, those look goofy as well), we’re great & I can only use them on the Bitmoji app now & you see them when you edit bitmoji on Snapchat. I just don’t like it and there’s not an option to change it - I feel like that should be an option for users.

Haven’t looked into the Snapchat+ but that just sounds silly to me. The way everything is going sounds like downhill and I think the only reason I have kept Snapchat is for the Memories.",Lorain1996

(priority) PLEASE make the discover part optional. it is rotting my brain & ik there’s other ppl who feel the same way & would turn it off. the titles are not good, there’s kids who use snap & look at those weird clickbaits. 3. the quick add after the stories like i don’t even have my own quick add on. no thanks. 4. why the filters coming w sounds now",Janhernan
Snapchat,2022-09-02 17:25:49,They locked me out of my 7 year old account,1,"I’ve been using Snapchat for around 7 years now. My generation has made Snapchat the new dm/iMessage, so for the better part of the last decade my whole life has been in this app. All of my photos, memories, contacts, everything were on my Snapchat account. Then today when I was trying to log into my account, out of nowhere I got logged out because apparently I was “compromising” my own account. After a couple attempts to reset my password using my phone number AND email, I got a notification saying my account was permanently locked. 7 years worth of memories and contacts erased because Snapchat couldn’t recognize my own freaking phone. The worst part is my account still exists, I’m just incapable of accessing it because there is not a real human person that works for Snapchat to talk to about it. If someone could please fix this I would be happy to take down this review. Thank you",geauxfly
Snapchat,2022-08-17 05:35:04,Love the app not a fan of the changes,4,"I love how Snapchat gave us the ability to change our usernames considering I made mine a very stupid one and it was time to change. I am not a fan of the fact that there is Snapchat+ that you have to pay for. I think that all the things that come with it are a little pointless, I understand that people who decide to pay for it are people who care, but it just seems strange. I don’t understand why being able to pin a number one best friend can be a thing. I’d you don’t snap them then they should not be your best friend. I do like that now the entire app had changed its immediate conversation deletes into them all lasting 24 hours, very helpful. I am also love that I get a months recap of the last month, and when I get flashbacks.",snapenthusiest
Snapchat,2023-04-09 10:06:26,This app turned to a cash grab,1,"I used to love this app because it wasn’t like instagram and Facebook. It wasn’t constantly shoving ads down your throat. Until now. I can’t go more than 2 posts without constantly seeing ads. It’s so annoying because not only do I not want to see them, it’s not relevant. I don’t care ab any of the companies. At least instagram tailors to my searches and shows me ads I might be interested in. Snapchat throws random ads that just annoy me. And I thought with Snapchat+ “oh great, an ad free version.” But no, sadly Snapchat+ doesn’t offer any great additions with the exception of pinning a number 1 best friend. Other than that, all the features seem pointless. Their new AI buddy feature seems the most out of place, as what’s the point of a robot “friend?” This app has been going downhill for some time but this really sets it in stone for me. If so many of my friends didn’t use this, I’d have been off this app long ago. Very disappointed.",cam fields
Snapchat,2023-04-15 15:44:44,"Love it, but they purposely take up space on your phone",1,"if you are that friend that takes videos and pictures, this app is NOT for you.
snapchat does not let you mass delete photos and videos, only 100 at a time. there are certain things in the ""stories"" box that snapchat FORCES you to keep even if you want it off your storage. 
and even if you go through and try to delete the 100 at a time, after a good 300 or so, it glitches out and you need to reset your phone. it's almost like they want to take up space on your phone to go along with phone companies so you buy a new one. i have an iphone 13, all updated and everything. it works fine, but snapchat is the root reason for the glitches and slowing. if you're like me, take it easy with the videos and pictures because snapchat will also save multiple copies of that ONE picture or videos for no reason. it gets frustraiting and this was my last straw.",Follower of Christ Jesus!!!!
Snapchat,2023-03-15 07:16:01,Love it! I have a suggestion,5,Love Snapchat been using it since 2018 and have been really enjoying it ever since. However I do want to make a suggestion. Can you please please add a option to where we can select multiple people at a time and hit remove this amount.  The amount of people I have on my snap who I don’t talk to is crazy and the simple of just removing them one at a time is highly time consuming. I think the selecting multiple people and deleting them off your snap (in this case unfriending them) is a great way to mass delete people that’s just sitting on your snap who you don’t talk too. Really would love this feature as I do have a lot of people and want to remove majority of them😂,Truckin🤙🏾
Snapchat,2023-03-07 19:33:47,Notifications,1,"Update: I have never subscribed to the “African Vibes” story. I keep getting notifications, maybe about once or twice a week, to view the stories from African Vibes. I look at the app and it says I’m subscribed, so I keep unfollowing the account just to get another notification from African Vibes and unfollow them again. Listed below is another issue that many people and I are dealing with. If I can’t enjoy my experience with the app, then I might as well delete it if the developers don’t want to fix these issues.

So I usually haven’t had any issues with Snapchat before, but now it doesn’t send me notifications sometimes. I thought maybe it was just my phone but a bunch of friends are having the same issue. I’ve tried restarting my phone, updating the app, just about everything and it still doesn’t send me message notifications sometimes (by sometimes I mean at least a message a day, sometimes more in a day)",Kails727

I used to laugh and cry while playing those fun games with my friends. But then February 1st of 2023 we knew something was missing but couldn’t put our finger on what until we had free time that very weekend. Then we found that they had deleted all of the Snapchat games known to man. We first thought that they were just renovating all the games since we did see that some of the games had a few  flaws. But then we saw on the Snapchat help page and on google that the shutdown was ongoing. Words cannot explain how upset I am at Snapchat for this. This is why I am here today giving the one star review to Snapchat because they knew that even if a lot of people didn’t play the games a whole lot of people dead, and until they can give those games back to me and all the others that loved it this one star review will stay.",hii how you doing

this is the second time i have been either locked, banned, or aren’t allowed to add anymore friends on snap for zero reason. i’m innocent here and this is ridiculous. i get messages everyday about scammers trying to hack into my cashapp but that’s okay right? doesn’t make sense young men!! please fix this problem because it seems like i’m not the only one having it and ur app is gonna go downhill soon if u don’t. thanks but i’m dissatisfied and i used to rave abt this app.",Mad dog 234568

In the nearly 10 years ive used snapchat ive never felt like leaving a good or bad review. But today my snapchat updated and i hate it and i must let you know in hopes you fix this atrocity. When i record a snapchat video the circle turns into a SQUARE now. Horrendous. And a snapchat ghost blinks at the top of your screen. Gross but not my motivation for a review after all these years. Its the fact the SQUARE doesnt show how much time you have left to record like the circle before did. That “filling” up circle every 10 seconds that inevitably stops recording at a minute.

At this point I lost hope and just waited a week then tried to log in and you guessed it, it didn’t work. So I reached out to Snapchat support, no response not even a follow up message to acknowledge my report. Now 2 months later no response from support, no way to create a new account, I went to the web version but of course you can’t open snaps on the web version.

Snapchat,2022-10-22 16:08:05,Disappointed,1,I  extremely disappointed with Snapchat. I’ve had my account for 8yrs and I’m currently having troubles with it and no way of getting ahold of anyone through Snapchat to get it resolved. I’ve been dealing with issues of me getting locked out of my account after having to forcibly restore my iPhone 11 Pro Max and since have not had any access to my account. Anytime I’ve reached out to snap support I’ve been reached back by automotive services that are completely useless and no help. I have not violated any community guidelines and I’ve accepted many friend requests because I’ve received them so I’m not sure if that has anything to do with anything. It’s unfortunate that I’m not able to have access to my account and app when I have memories and contacts that I don’t have backed up and been using for years. I’m disappointed that there is no one we can contact and speak to over the phone to have these matters resolved.,Mamii_chula305

I followed the directions to receive a password reset link, but upon opening my email, received a notice of a permanent lock on my account. I read through the community guidelines and terms of service and there was nothing I did wrong. I looked on twitter and many other people have had this issue after using the app the same way we have for years. Photos of my kids growing up are also all gone now as they were saved in the “memories” feature.

Snapchat,2022-08-27 12:40:33,Discover page is horrible,2,"I see a lot of reviews about the ads in Discover videos, which are certainly awful. But, the ads are not half as awful as the videos themselves. Snapchat came around when I was in middle school I believe, and I cannot imagine middle schoolers going through the Discover page these days. Most of the videos are sexual, I scrolled through just now and there were three articles with “pornstar” in the caption. The rest depict people who have made horrible life choices, like tattooing their eyeballs, or getting piercings in every part of their face, and tell the reader that that is a perfectly acceptable way to live. Not if you want a job it’s not. 

Maybe everyone who uses Snapchat these days is an adult with a fully formed brain, and will not be influenced negatively by these things, but I doubt it. Maybe have some news stories instead idk.",Justadude393
Snapchat,2022-12-14 20:37:52,Device Banned PERMANENTLY,1,"I’ve been device banned since mid October for no reason at all. Snapchat is starting to ban people who use emojis like: 🍄, 🍃, ⛽️, etc. on public stories. The context can be completely unrelated to the emoji and you’ll still get banned. It seems like they’re using some type of AI to detect and ban people who use it. And it’s not fair that you cannot submit an appeal for the team to review your case. So essentially, once your account is gone… it’s gone! All your memories included! You can’t log back in even if your account is still active. Because guess what— it is! People can still text your account even though it’s been banned and you can’t get into it. It’s stupid! And since I’m device banned, I cannot make another Snapchat account on this phone. This app is starting to take a scary turn and I hate it. It used to be fun and a cool way to talk to people, but now they’re just running their users away. Snapchat.. FIX THIS!",KaoriK.

I posted a shoutout ( Whitch I have done before and other people have shouted out this person too) and then my account is now permanently locked and that’s 5 years of Snapchat memories I can’t get back pictures of my sister starting the day she was born  and picture of my brother as well and now all those pictures (she is 2 and my brother is 8 months) I can’t get back and let me tell you I litterly cried for 3 hours, picture of me and my grandma are in there and pictures and voice messages from my homie who died two years ago I will never be able to hear again. I had so many irreplaceable memories and I complained and Snapchat won’t unlock it for me I sent 4+ requests I am so upset about this and I’m mad because Snapchat won’t unlock it more me I hope you are happy that I cried for 3 ours out of frustration and sadness I hope you enjoy all those pictures of my babies 😭😭😭",lil_m0mma123
Snapchat,2022-09-22 23:59:43,Snapchat,5,ih I love Snapchat because it has so many filters and it has a way to communicate with your Friends and family I love how Snapchat whenever you call people you can still have filters it’s easy to flip the camera and they provide plenty of filters there are a couple things that I don’t like about Snapchat but they’re not too bad I don’t like how are you a four year old can make your account and then just friend every single person and I also don’t like how people appropriate things on  this app this app is not for kids I feel like my age limit you should be at least 18 or older to be able to be on this app thank you for your time.

Snapchat,2023-04-08 09:50:35,It needs more clothing,4,"Great app! It’s super good for socializing and communicating with your friends or irl friends if needed. Although there’s not that much clothing choices, in styles other then the well known ones. Im more of an alternate person, and I prefer to use leg warmers, arm warmers, long arm gloves, and other types of stuff! I also recommend maybe using layering options, like the “tuck-in” one. Maybe you can have a choice to put a sweatshirt under a T-Shirt, to make it more clear what it’s supposed to be. bracelets, and chokers/necklaces would be a great add as well! Maybe for another idea, sponsor Hottopic for things like that! Overall, I think this is a super good app. I love playing the mini games with my friends and it’s fun to use, but I think you should have more clothing choices.",Swirly OpalZ
Snapchat,2023-02-14 17:49:56,I have never been so upset.,1,I had a main account that started back in 2018 and had it up until 2022. in 2022 i got my account permanently locked but wasn’t told why and i didn’t do anything wrong nor did i break the guidelines. i then set up a new account and went on my way. then that account was permanently locked and i didn’t do anything to get that one locked. so i ignored it went on my way and made one last new one. got in and 20 minutes later was locked. i gave up trying because i didn’t feel any point of having an app that’s gonna keep locking my accounts so i deleted it. i had it deleted for up to 4 months and i made a new account recently on my ipad’s snapchat. that account is still doing okay right now but i tried ushing my phone to log in on that account and it wont let me at all. it’s telling me i’m not allowed to. i would like to know why i cannot when i clearly have an account. i am so upset.,jxrhkjv
Snapchat,2022-11-05 01:27:19,Snapchat doesn’t care,1,I’ve used Snapchat for a couple of years and it has gotten to be the worst app I ever used. Snapchat temporarily banned my account gives me my account and bans me every single day. When my account locks I use their link to see what I got banned for. When you check their website it doesn’t tell you what you did. I barely even use snap but I need it for communication to people I know because I don’t have their number. I’m very upset because when Snapchat unlocks my account they ban it right after I close my app and the cycle repeats every 24 hours. What also upsets me is you can tell them what’s wrong with their app and they don’t fix what doesn’t work they only add stuff to the app. If anyone knows how to fix this glitch my social on Instagram-(for only helping people) is Revilthedevil if you can help me please Dm and I will delete this review. Thank you for reading this full review if you did.,Wavy_RJD
Snapchat,2022-08-29 23:47:22,Love it until now.,3,"I love this app but what so ever the app today has been acting up, every time i try to look at my friends stories it kicks me out and i've tried shutting my phone off completely and have updated the Snap chat app. idk how to fix this and i'm so beyond mad because i wanna see what going on in their stories but i can't seem to fix the problem so ima leave my snap alone for a bit and see if it will work in a couple of hours? hopefully it starts to work again. it made mad but i think it's doing me good by not being on snapchat all day lol. and just let's get started on the other problems. i want where you can unlink ur bitmoji and still have those bitmoji stickers and where they let us pick the unlinked bitmoji color, maybe i'm just complaining but i want more stuff added lol.",skys problems
Snapchat,2023-04-07 06:22:45,Permanently locked account with no warning.,2,"Got my account permanently locked and I’ve had snap for over 5 years, haven’t posted or done anything different than what I have since I got this app. Lost all my contacts, memories, everything to do with it and i’ll never be able to get it back. old pictures of me, my family, dead pets. Absolutely no warning at all and just lost everything. How can you just do that to someone with no warning or any type of heads up. Should not just be an automatic account deletion. Peoples lives are on here and deleting their entire account with no warning is unfair and ridiculous, not to mention you can’t get ahold of anyone that works with snapchat to help, you’ll just end up talking to bots or never hear back from them. Pathetic that this is what a multi million dollar or even billion dollar business does/ treats users.",Cstrouse1
Snapchat,2023-03-19 20:00:14,I’ve had snapchat forever but,4,I’ve just notice that they changed a setting with stories by i think it’s only for people with public profiles cause i used to have my story set to where everyone that has me added can see it even if i do not have them added back and now they took that feature out to where it’s only showing two options to show my friends and customs to where i can block people from seeing but if i want everyone to see my story i have to put it on my public story which is very annoying i liked it when it was set to everyone that way if i didn’t have someone added and they messages me on another to add them back that i could just look at my story and add them but now i can’t,Tylena jones
Snapchat,2022-10-11 23:08:05,WISH THERE WAS A WAY TO REPLY TO MESSAGES VIA APPLE WATCH,4,"Listen I love Snapchat. It’s probably my most used app. I have multiple group chats with friends, family and coworkers. My only gripe is when I get a notification on my Apple Watch all I can do is click on the notification. It might be wishful thinking or just entitlement, but I really wish there was a way for me to open the chat and reply to text chats. I could understand not adding the actual photo and video portion, but just the text chats would be amazing and really improve my personal experience with the app. 

I don’t know if anyone else in the world out there feels the same way but if you do, please leave a similar review so hopefully they can implement something along these lines. 

Sincerely, Snapchat user",Kc_Reviews
Snapchat,2022-08-31 23:15:59,wouldn’t recommend Snapchat to anyone due to prior account deletion and no response since.,1,"For some reason it won’t let me type in the review box. I used to love Snapchat and be an avid fan of it but over the last two years it’s been a bit of a falling out. I had an original account with over 500 friends and family. I linked my OF when I had one for a couple months not knowing that was against terms. Had I known I never would have done it. I was immediately reported by a follower and my 5+ year old account was deleted in Nov’20. I contacted Snapchat numerous times to try to reason with them with multiple generic automatic responses but absolutely no help, “just be patient.” After a year I gave up. I lost all my photos and memories on there of my 10 year old Dane that passed in April ‘20. It was honestly devastating. I’d love to have my original account but now wouldn’t recommend anyone to use Snapchat.",ThrowIt987
Snapchat,2022-08-31 21:22:18,Great but a bit annoying,4,"I've been using the app for a while now and it's pretty good. I do have an issue that I'd like to address though – my avatar. Every time I would go and change my avatar, I'd save it then turn off the app. Then, when I went back to it, it would look like the same avatar I had before I change it to a new one. I feel like Snapchat has already been working on this issue because it hasn't really been happening to me a lot but it has happened a couple times again. Also, the ad breaks are really annoying! Every three minutes I'm watching a story, a stupid ad will always pop up that I can't skip for no reason at all. otherwise, pretty good app for texting and keeping in touch with friends!",queen💅👑💎✨
Snapchat,2022-12-02 04:02:52,Updates.. 😬,4,"I’ve been using snap for many years and he app itself is great it’s just the updates recently are just becoming so useless. For example, the whole 3d bitmoji thing is just so ugly and honestly kinda creepy. I think that there should be an option to use the 3d bitmojis or not (like how you could choose between the bitmoji styles) also the whole screenshot thing, first of all the items it finds are nowhere close to what’s in the actual picture. I just feel that it won’t get use not only because it’s inaccurate, but also because this is something people could just use google lens for. I know apps copy features but I feel like if google already has it why copy it? I mean pretty much everyone uses google.",YuHHHH4569
Snapchat,2022-09-29 16:42:30,Got Worse Over Time,1,This app has been great since i got it in 2014 i loved the simplicity and easy communication. But over time for them to get more income they started doing ads and whatnot and i get it but it became more of a social media than communication to me. I think stories were a good way to have something be there and you see it or you don’t. But over time the quality of the app worsened. And recently i got randomly locked out of my account. And i am not able to retrieve it. I have had memories on there from the past 8 years of my life and i will probably never see them again. I am unable to verify my own email and phone number to get in for whatever reason though it is one’s i have access too and use. Their support has not done anything to help me. I wish there was a better security system to gain access considering they have more money from ads. and premium features.,Marissacabd
Snapchat,2023-04-06 05:30:28,"Good, but feels broken now",4,"I’ve used snap since 2014 and I feel it’s broken one of the best features on its subscription feeds. used to be able to swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open the link that the poster attached for more information such as a news article. That seems to no longer work and it’s extremely disappointing. The new bottom bar covers portions of snaps from friends, feeds, and just a general nuisance. The filters and camera features remain to be fun and engaging but I can’t help but feel it’s a little bit broken because of the new bottom bar. I find myself using this half less and less with the spammy snap+ ads, more ads in stories, and the bottom bar’s interference",Cdyphilip
Snapchat,2023-01-07 18:45:25,Privacy/location instructions,4,"I love love Snapchat. The memories flashbacks that appear on Snapchat is what I love the most. The filters are my second favorite, and the emojis that show up between you and a friend like the heart 💛or smiling face 😊showing the status of a friendship. There is only one tiny issue (issue for me that has ADD), is understanding the instructions on enabling the ghost mode. I have to reread to understand. I get confused about enabling that feature because I feel like turning it on is going to show my location (which I don’t want) or is that how you turn off your location??? Again, it’s not necessarily a flaw of Snapchat, but would be great if Snapchat could be a little more “user friendly” for ADD users 😊 thank you Snapchat",KikaCaliGirl1008
Snapchat,2022-12-17 20:05:53,Love it but needs work. Suggestion:,3,"I’ve had Snapchat for several years and my account had Authenticator set up in it. When I transferred my phone to anew phone it didn’t transfer anything else with it so I lost everything. All my other social media apps would send me a text or email instead. Not Snapchat. Plus not to mention the Snapchat help center was rude and unhelpful and acted like I was supposed to know that there was absolutely ZERO way to recover anything. They couldn’t send a text, email, or even call me to reset anything. My other social media apps always text you or email you if you can’t get into Google Authenticator. It’s just very frustrating that I lost everything and had no way of recovering anything. Especially since other social medias do not have this problem.",TheCatLover427

Your constantly-evolving filters and features have allowed us to explore our individuality and express this in a variety of ways. Your innovative platform has connected more people in a more meaningful way, providing a safe and secure communication space.

Snapchat,2023-01-14 23:20:39,AMAZING,5,"I absolutely ❤Snapchat but there are some things you should know. Snapchat easily allows random people to add you but you can decline the adds. You have a snap score too if you stay in touch with people you get different emoji rankings that you're can change. and even great filters, and you can add things to your story where people can see you pictures, but you can choose if you want to add it to your story or not. You can even make you story private or where your friends can only see it. You can also add your story to a spotlight a spotlight allows hundreds of people can see it but again that's optional. Overall I love Snapchat and I do recommend! ❤️❤️❤️",sheesh mel
Snapchat,2023-04-18 22:14:37,Love the app and have an idea.,5,I use snapchat ad one of many ways to communicate with people. And one of the things that would be nice to have would be a notification when someone opens your chat and reads your message. As a form of you guys giving the recipient a way of being acknowledged rather than being left not knowing when someone has read your message. Maybe its just me but it seems like a decent idea. And I wish snapchat had the ability to put someone as their significant other so it shows when someone is looked up or under quick add when you hit their profile that they are in a relationship or married.,TeliStriker
Snapchat,2022-09-11 02:15:03,Tiny issues but very frustrating,3,"So, something that really bothers me about this app, is some people don’t update on BF’s as fast as others do, they tell you about this, but they also don’t explain anything about bitmojis or why they display things, especially if the person didn’t update it themselves cause the app just does it. But seriously after unfriending people and re adding them and things change with a days time, the app is weird, I’m sure it has to do with your activity but they make everything so vague, like why even give us these perks if they’re not accurate or they can’t take the time to explain anything. Seems like they want to create issues between friends. Like wrong location or whatever. There’s a lot more they need to improve with this app.",Getsomedawg
Snapchat,2022-08-28 15:06:09,Censoring Content,1,Snapchat works when it wants to work. Right now as we speak it’s not showing me my text while writing this review. I have the screenshot to prove it. Thank God for the person whom created the predictive text right above your keyboard 😮‍💨🫠. Either way when it’s not censoring your review it’s not posting your content to your storyline. You will get 100 notifications a day if you do not turn the notifications off. Doesn’t matter on the content or your internet connection it fails on 5G & Wi-Fi. No other social media app does this to this extent so be weary when you are using Snapchat. They can make all the updates that they want but if their team isn’t up to the task of eliminating the bugs & glitches as well as the failed commands of their app: it really doesn’t matter who you are you’re not important & they clearly don’t want you to have a memorable experience using their app.,JWoodson22
Snapchat,2023-03-14 13:28:21,Too many ads; not appropriate for kids/teens,4,Y’all need to change how often you show ads whilst watching video subs. I can’t even watch a video for 15 seconds without an ad (that I can’t skip) playing. Then the ads mess up how the actual videos play out. Stuff gets skipped a lot. Sometimes I just close the app cuz it’s so annoying. Some of those channels are really interesting and Fun but the ads OMG And why are y’all constantly showing stuff that should be for adults only? You have to know that kids/teens use the app but y’all wanna glamorize/romanticize sex work and grooming libs. Instead of glorifying real careers that actually take work to succeed in. Y’all have a great platform to help our youth instead of leading them down a trash path.,Rae.ors
Snapchat,2022-12-21 19:25:48,Amazing but a few problems,4,"Snapchat is a great method to chat people with! It’s super easy to learn how if you have just started! The filters are great and they have so many! Although I do have a few problems. 1: you get notifs from random ppl. One time me and my friend were hanging out and Snapchat notified me “ Bla bla is online” It was her uncle. Sometimes I’ll get notifs from people I have never heard of or never even met. 2: Snapchat gives you WAYYY to many notifs. It’ll keep on reminding me things or just telling me to try new filters. 3: I think this is only me but I don’t know how to unfriend people. I accidentally friended someone a long time ago and can’t unfriend them. Otherwise from these problems I love Snapchat.

Thank you for reading this.",Mal$$$2018
Snapchat,2022-11-13 02:42:18,they don’t look at ANY of the reports,4,"I reported someone’s story for animal abuse (it was severe animal abuse - which is not tolerated according to their guidelines). But they got back to me not even an hour later saying they checked my report and said it does not go against their guidelines. This is absolutely ridiculous because it 100% did violate their guidelines and was a horrendous thing to see. They either did not care to check their reports and said they “checked” it, or they do not care that someone did something like this to an animal and just allowed the story to stay there. Either way, this is not okay. This story should have been deleted and I am disgusted by the way they responded to this. YOU NEED TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT YOUR REPORTS. PEOPLE REPORT THINGS FOR A REASON.",madisonni
Snapchat,2022-11-04 03:10:12,Great App until….,2,So I have been a great fan of this app but Starting a few days ago My snapchat got randomly banned out of nowhere! All my memories and friends I had added gone! Luckily it was a temporary ban so I got it back after 10 hours but then it got banned again like 10 minutes after. The cycle just continues it gets unbanned and gets banned again it won’t stop!!! The thing is there’s absolutely no one you can get in contact with it’s just automated bots! This huge platform and no one to get in contact with! I’ve bought merch from snapchat and been a great supporter for everything and The fact that this is going on to me is unbelievable hopefully we can get this resolved! I’ve read the Guidelines over and over and not one broken rule I just want to know what’s the reason so we can get it fixed and I can get my stuff back!,yo daddy and mommy
Snapchat,2022-08-30 06:13:55,A slightly social messaging app.,5,"This app shines in its messaging features. So often it is hard to convey tone or subtext over text, but Snapchat makes it seamless to put your text over a picture of your face, or record a clip or voice message. Feels like a really rich messaging app, with a hint of social media via the “stories” feature. Which can be used a lot or totally ignored. 

My one gripe is there’s a few snags around how it interfaces with the photo library, but 🤷‍♂️. 

Also worth knowing is this app doesn’t always do a great job explaining itself, so might need to Google how to use some features or ask a friend. But once you know how, it’s a very smooth experience",Stoneycode
Snapchat,2022-12-04 19:08:42,Saving memories to camera,5,"I love Snapchat. It has only gotten better over time and they have truly made a name for themselves. I remember when they still had ads at the bottom of the chat page. However, recently when I was trying to save some memories I realized I could not. My only option was to send or post them. I had struggled for two days to figure it out and then finally gave up and googled it. The new way to save videos isn’t just unnecessarily lengthy, but it only saves the videos in 10-second increments. This has always been my pet peeve with Snapchat especially when it was easier to save videos. Please fix this!!!!",Wrost app eva
Snapchat,2022-08-30 03:33:35,3D selfie issue,3,"I really think it’s cool that Snapchat is implementing more ways to be creative with bitmojis, however most can agree especially in bitstrip style the 3D style looks very strange and takes the hat off your bitmoji. I also don’t have any selfie options so in my 2D selfie I’m just sitting there smiling. I made this account before the 3D update because I wanted a refreshed account with only people I actually talk to and the most frustrating thing to see, of all things is this. It’s not really that important, it’s just one of those things that’s small but just big enough to be super annoying. Maybe make 3D selfie options for other avatar styles and make 3D selfies in general optional. We still see the 2D selfie when we’re texting each other and we can’t customize that anymore?",ausisuv
Snapchat,2023-03-13 12:26:07,I would have gave it 5 but…,3,I don’t think that permanently banning snap accounts over little things is fair or right. I have used snap ever since I was a kid and randomly got banned one day for posting my glass pieces on my story. All my memories and friends lost. It was my first time ever getting banned and my account got permanently banned and I have to get a new phone if so. It’s an issue for me to post clean glass pieces but there can be sex chat bots or scam chats that constantly add you and message you constantly. It’s just frustrating having my whole life on there but it gets lost within minutes of posting glass pieces. Just doesn’t seem exactly fair to anyone lol. Like it was my first time and I can’t even have snap on the phone anymore? That’s not right. But other than that I’ve loved snap.,Skillful Master Workout
Snapchat,2023-03-12 13:37:48,No Real-time Support from Developers,1,"I have sent several emails to Snapchat support, but it says no one monitors emails and I likely won’t have my messages read by a real person 😭 my app has stopped working after the last app update happened five days ago, and I need help with getting my app to open and work again. Apple Support tried to help me, but they told me they couldn’t get it to work and I needed to communicate with the app developer directly. There is no where on website to receive support beyond an FAQ page that doesn’t help, my app won’t open to reach the support team there, and there is no guarantee to receive timely help when issues arise (if one gets help at all) when filling out a “Contact Us” form. I feel like this is my last chance at receiving help from developers, so I’m hoping it’s seen 🙏🏼 Will someone please reach out and help me get my app restored and working again?",tabitha.nolan
Snapchat,2023-03-06 16:46:09,Less is more.,1,"I can’t stand the discover page. Incredibly obnoxious constantly shoving garbage in front of your face you just don’t want to see and on the off chance you might actually want to watch something it’s riddled with an obnoxious amount off adds that make it u watchable. The fact is the majority of the content is just immoral smut and there’s no way to filter or disable it. I’m certainly not the only one who feels this way, in fact i’d say the majority feels this way. But to bad Snapchat as a company couldn’t care less about its users, just one simple thing…money. 

Secondly, “random memories”. Can you not? I wanna see my daily memories not the random ones Snapchat decides it wants to show, not the random collection of snaps from a certain location, not a end of the month recap. Stop forcing these garbage new features and give us the option to disable the trash we don’t want to see.",Alfano95_
Snapchat,2023-02-15 11:33:27,Director Tool is Pointless,1,"For a long time I’ve had to re-select all of my favorite lenses every day because they would all be deleted by the following day (total design fail but I got used to it).  Since Director mode was launched I cannot even use other lenses, there is no way to select a filter and use it to create a 60-second video.  No matter how much time I spend re-saving the same set of lenses I save over and over every day, once I hit Directors Mode I lose every lens.  I can’t go into the Lenses area to access my favorites  because there is now a permanent graphic that only appeared a few days ago that says to press and hold to add to your favorites but it blocks access to that screen.  I don’t understand why the engineers at Snapchat continually make operating this app harder, but it’s become way more confusing lately and trying to get ahold of someone to assist is a total waste of time.",tbcbtbcbt
Snapchat,2022-08-22 05:03:36,Snap,5,"It is such a good app I love it and it’s super easy to chat with your friends and family .This app is amazing and I would recommend getting snapchat, because it is super fun. You can snap your best friends who moved away or are in another country. You can get to know people at your school. You can FaceTime people if one of your friends doesn’t have iPhone but you do. You can post story’s create Bitmojis. You can talk to your crush or boyfriend if you don’t have there number and get to know them better. There are so many reasons why Snapchat is so good but that’s just a few. So lastly, if you don’t have Snapchat now you should get it. It is a 10/10 app. Bye",dog kiver
Snapchat,2022-11-15 18:40:36,Keep getting charged when not subscribed,2,"We have always loved this app, but have recently discovered that every time we log out and log back in, we get charged for the subscription and even though I cancel immediately and ask for a refund, I am not being issued a refund. This is extremely frustrating as this amount adds up as my kids sign out of the app frequently and unsubscribe every time they log back in. This is unacceptable as there isn’t even a question asking if we want to subscribe or a way yo opt out before charging us, we just get charged. Is anybody else having this problem? I’ve tried to contact customer service and there is no way to reach them about this issue. I’m absolutely at a loss and am ready to make my family delete the app permanently if this continues. Any suggestions?",msgaparicio
Snapchat,2022-10-12 00:55:53,Good but I have a problem..,4,"This app is honestly really good, I’ve been using it for years and years. I really like this app because it’s simple and I love how there’s a quick add and things like that. But I have 1 problem. Basically, I turned my location off because I don’t feel comfortable with strangers seeing my location. There’s apparently something called ‘Snapchat pro’ you could purchase it with money. And technically it allows people to see your location even if you hid your location. I’ve hid my location for a reason so I don’t feel happy with them seeing my location. Snapchat you need to respect our privacy. Overall the app is good but it could glitch, or crash now there and then.",THE RUMORS ARE TRUE!!!
Snapchat,2023-01-12 17:25:36,Snapchat is Out,1,"Earlier today I messaged Snapchat support explaining to them my situation. I was “temporarily” locked out of my Snapchat for reasons I am unaware of. I followed all the necessary steps to get access back into my account, as I have photos in my memories of my deceased father that I do not have stored elsewhere. When nothing worked to get me back into my account I emailed them to which they so kindly responded “there’s nothing we can do.” I explained even further how upset I would be if I never got to see those pictures, and again they responded in a careless matter and told me they would no longer be responding to me. This has broken my heart as I now know I have to live with the fact that I will never see those photos again. I hope the right person sees this review and Snapchat does something about their customer service and not be so careless in locking accounts for no reason.",Briob2
Snapchat,2023-03-29 05:26:31,From treasure,5,I think Snapchat is amazing 10 out of10 it’s useful and you can watch shorts and text and call your friends it’s awesome how you can do a bunch of things while you’re texting your friends oh my love the privacy it’s honestly really cool and it’s really good for me because it has a bunch of cool like you know coat on your face is it now and it’s like really fun that because I can go to school and me and my friends can do a bunch of things with them I definitely would think it’s the best type for me I will definitely read it up probably a 10 or 100 I think it’s awesome thank you guys for making this yeah from Treasure I’m 15 and my Snapchat by,Treasure queen brown
Snapchat,2023-04-18 12:46:28,Annoyed by Chnage,4,"This would be a 5 star review if It wasn’t for recent changes to adding to your story. I don’t care to have nor do I want to have a public story. Further more you’d think that hitting the add to story button would default to adding it to your regular story. But no, you’ve designed the story button to default add to your public story. This is a extremely annoying change because almost every time I’ve posted a story since the most recent update it goes straight to my public story which I do not want it to do so. Maybe look into making a custom setting where you can designate where you want your stories to post by default when clicking the add to story button.",KingFoolyCooly
Snapchat,2023-04-16 12:26:59,Weird bugs and anonymous viewers!,1,"3 days ago I updated my Snapchat and suddenly when I post on my story, I can only see if there are nonsubscribers that watched my story but it won’t show the names anymore. There’s also someone in my friends list that watches my story but it doesn’t show their name. Each time I post on my story, a few minutes later I see “4 people viewed your story” but it only shows 3 names. Or just a few minutes ago I posted a story and it showed that 1 person viewed my story so far but it doesn’t show the name… almost like as if there’s an anonymous watcher… Snapchat will also show you that your story was screenshot but it won’t show who screenshot it. It’s the weirdest thing and I just wish to have my old version of Snapchat back. Sometimes some pictures or snapchats take longer to post. It’ll say “finishing up” and stays like that for 5-10 min",123RayBurd
Snapchat,2023-01-28 22:00:00,Not really helpful,4,I was so excited I had my Snapchat for over 5 years and had a big dnoscore then one day I went back to the app when I woke up and my account was permanently locked and I had done nothing to break the guidelines at all and it frustrates me Becasue my memories of pets that passed away my family being goofy and private stuff it really upsets me:( snapchat needs to do better and then when I contacted them I have been waiting a week and nothing has happened and I lost over 4 year streaks and it upsets me a lot and I want to delete this app and never install it again but it’s how I get ahold of my friends so I cant and me and my boyfriends chats and messages are gone it Turkey upsets me to this day still!:(,awesome at rvrythinf

You have been tell my boyfriend that I’ve been active while he’s still on delivered. Which is very much a lie because the only reason I go on to Snapchat is to snap back my boyfriend. And so now he’s convinced that I’m ignoring his snaps, which is so not true. See what you did snapchat, do you understand how bad this looks for me. I’m not sure what the problem is but you gotta fix it man. OH ANDDDD the whole premium thingy with the yellow lines and stuff. You need to take that away that stuff is mad creepy.

Snapchat,2022-08-31 10:16:41,Has gone way downhill since it’s first couple of years,1,"This app use to be the app to message friends and send funny selfies or pictures to friends while talking to them. But they got money hungry and now put all this extra garbage on their app that genuinely no one cares about. Their new discovery page that use to be where you could go to see your friends snap stories quickly turned into crap you don’t care about and don’t want on your app. And don’t even get me started on the ads they literally bombard you with constantly. Same ad multiple times and most you can’t skip for 6 seconds when people are literally just trying to snap friends and family. This app is a joke anymore and they just keep making worse. Here Snapchat, you want me to rate your app so bad, here it is. Stop being money hungry and start being a normal way to talk to people.",its youre boi
Snapchat,2023-02-28 17:01:34,Weird issue with maps and U/I,4,There’s a weird issue on my phone with snap. I’m on the latest iOS v 16.3.1 and have an iPhone 14 pro max and when I click the snap map the button clicks slightly higher than where I actually click. I also have a weird U/I when I first open the app to see the camera it’s like there’s a good 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch of black before I see the screen where the image is for the camera to where the buttons are to move from the app and the image for the camera goes through the island. Not sure if it was meant for this to come down so the image of the camera is in full view without interference from the island but I think it shifted it off on the maps too.,Thejoh7

Losing hundreds of memories and contacts I’ve had for basically ever. I’ve contacted “customer support” through their support website explaining how there’s been a mistake and I should not have been locked out.  I even reached out on twitter and they directed me to customer support as well but when I submit my request I get an automated email saying “ Our Snapchat support team will not be able to unlock your account for you.”  “ when I’ve heard miracle stories of them being able to reverse the issue. I have looked and researched everywhere and I can’t even reach an real human being to explain my case. I don’t understand. Can I just get somebody. Anybody to help me. It’s only locked. Just unlock it.,itsreallynotzach
Snapchat,2022-11-06 17:50:16,Good social media app,5,"This app is great for communicating with friends and family. It also has a lot of cool features. When it comes to filters they have tons of options and it keeps things fun and interesting. The only thing I find odd with this app is that when advertisements pop up it takes a few swipes to get out of the screen, even just to get back to your original phone home screen. Maybe it’s a glitch but it would be nice to just be able to get out of the advertisements without having to swipe out of it so many times before it actually does. Other than that, this app is good.",Mooncakekate
Snapchat,2022-10-17 15:21:46,They deleted my account,1,"I have been an active member of Snapchat literally since it came out. It is my MAIN for of communication, how I share my day’s experiences through photos with friends, and how I stay updated with friends and family. I was recently permanently banned from Snapchat and I think it’s pretty bizarre how I’ve been reaching out to customer support and nobody has been able to help me with this! Looking over the guidelines I technically did not do anything to get my account banned. So I would at least like to know WHY MY ACCOUNT WAS BANNED IN THE FIRST PLACE. I know I should just move on with life. But Snapchat holds a lot of my precious memories, I also just moved across the United States, it was my main form of communication and staying in touch with people so I. Am just feeling really down and depressed about this AND SNAPCHAT IS NO HELP AT ALL. Snapchat is a great app but they HAVE TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.",fuddsinthehouse
Snapchat,2022-08-21 04:56:04,Updates have destroyed this app.,2,"This used to be a very good app. Snapchat has updated and has been messing up for a few days now. At first it wouldn’t allow you to add back the people that added you. That was fixed. Next you couldn’t send snaps or messages or even post on your story. I’ve had snap since 2017 never had a issue with it. Today I get on and I’ve been permanently locked out. I was not going against community guideline or doing anything inappropriate. I was given no reason as to why my account has been permanently locked. I sent a email and received one back stating “Unfortunately, sometime legitimate accounts get locked by mistake”.  Seriously?! I’ve lost all my pictures and most were very important to me. Pets that have passed away and I’ve lost all pictures and videos of them.",Ally122718

But now they are trying to get you to buy this premium garbage and they advertise to an unimaginable amount. Log in, check out the new premium, even when you hit the x on the add it brings you to the page to purchase this crap. Then you have to hit the x again. It’s a obviously just a minor inconvenience but try to set an example as a good company and quit trying to slowly ruin the world with advertisement. They keep adding one little thing at a time and eventually it’ll be an ad for premium every time you login or some crap. I’m getting so sick of it… and I’d happily get a cheap ad free version but 30 bucks on recurring payments. When the free version is right there it’s hard to justify that amount. Maybe do that but make it a one time purchase.",Buttholes12343454567678989

I literally did NOTHING WRONG and y’all banned me. People will literally report you out of pettiness and the warnings? Ridiculous when quite literally I’ve never posted anything wrong. You’re going to lose a lot of people due to this. I can understand being suspended for a few weeks, and turning it into months etc if you keep violating rules but I LITERALLY got device banned. This is absolutely mf RIDICULOUS!!! I lost all of my memories, my everything! I’m being banned for nothing and your customer service is just straight up not willing to work with you, when I report people who post LITERAL porn on thier story you don’t even BAN THEM???

Snapchat,2023-03-03 10:06:12,Too many ads now,4,"I used to love SnapChat and watching the stories, but now there are just too many ads that are not placed well.  The ads interrupt not only the contributors mid-sentence, but mid-word distracting and sometimes making content storytelling harder to follow.  I get that ads are needed for financial contribution to SnapChat and/or content contributors, but it’s got ridiculous that you can’t even get through 15 seconds of content before another ad interrupting.  Be more strategic with ad placements please.  Current structure is frustrating for the user (I usually just close out of the app) and makes me less interested/likely in purchasing the item or service being advertised.",KCByington
Snapchat,2022-11-15 13:57:33,Used to be a great app,2,"When Snapchat added stories the app was perfect. I don’t think they’ve made a smart move since. While there are about 4-5 media outlets who make good content on the stories page, the rest of them make me feel like Snapchat thinks I’m stupid. The titles are so unbelievably cringey it actually brings me pain when I read them so I stay off that page. The actual content is usually complications of the worst kind of tik toks available, again, the ones that just make you cringe. Their off-brand tik tok page isn’t much better. Every video is of some random trick shot or sports catch with the caption “I won $XXX because I caught it”. Obviously they didn’t win that money, again, do they think I’m stupid? Or who do they think will actually watch these and be entertained? Be better Snapchat.",babykeemisntthegoat

So my snap-score just randomly disappears one day and me and this person have kept it going, we don’t wait 24 hours bc we don’t want to lose it but this has happened to me twice this week and it’s really annoying bc it’s a feature they let us have and we can’t even use it, and I’ve had this snap-score for over a yr so it’s rly annoying that this is not fixed. I’ve also had problems with it messing up my camera and some of my saved photos just missing, if this wasn’t a problem it’d be a great app, it’s still a good way to talk to friends just watch out for the weird people that add you.

I have my last pictures with my grandparents before they passed. I have so many pictures in their that my heart breaks that I am losing. A few years ago my camera roll was always full so I decided to just use snapchat for my pictures, it would save storage on my phone. Well now all of the pictures I took after that are gone.

Snapchat,2023-03-16 23:14:35,Snapchat should have the option to keep your memories from an old account,5,I’ve been using snapchat since middle school and since then Had a few different accounts and switch back and forth almost daily to look at my memories from a year two years and everything else. I just wish there was a way to transfer the memories from my old account to my present one with the original date and everything. It would make life so much easier and Snapchat would dominate as the ultimate photo album app. Other than that I love this app and I use it more than any other social media,nevayuhhh

It is so peaceful other than friends or randoms screenshotting or screen recording my stories it is my favorite app I like how it tell you if friends replay your snap or screenshot, save in chat or to camera roll when you send a picture or video so it notify you and so you’re not clueless of what’s happening you can express your self whenever you feel confident or show how your day is going(daily activity)and people can view it and show love swipe up and write something. I like this app and use it more than anything else.",JamesAndrew25
Snapchat,2023-02-05 15:20:01,Glitchy,2,"I liked this app a lot, as it was my main way to contact my friends, but lately, my snap has automatically been unadding people, it unadded one of my BEST FRIENDS and we were both under the impression that the other unadded the other until I reached out to ask why. I’m very frustrated. I love the filters, and the simplicity of the app, but now it’s been unadding my favorite people and that’s just something that NEEDS to be fixed immediately. I tried readding the accounts but you wanna know what happened? The account didn’t exist at all, but then my backup account could add them and that’s how we stayed on snap. I’m very disappointed in Snap, it’s supposed to be a nice, fun, easy way to stay in touch with people, but lately with all its new updates, it’s just becoming more and more of a pain to use.",RaWrhdhd
Snapchat,2022-11-11 18:26:47,"DONT USE. Privacy invasion, data robbing,, and unjust banning",1,"The worst customer service in the world. I wont even waste the time n energy to go in depth, just scroll and read reviews. Theyre almost all the same about this sketchy dying app. 7+ years of memories gone, deceased friends n family pics n vids gone forever. Been trying for 2-3 years to work with them on getting some back to no avail. 0 justifications or reasioning, and now 4-6 accounts banned or locked for no reasons…no 3rd party, explicit content, etc follow all rules. Also be weary of your data and privacy, their detection and banning process seems extremely sketch and invasive with no supplementary data or information on how or why they occur. Hope they get the response from the public they deserve eventually, someone make a better, fully free and open, communicative app rooted in just privacy and expression pleaseee!!!",pgisme
Snapchat,2022-11-03 22:58:37,I’m not satisfied with the app,1,"I’m not satisfied with this app because it’s more inappropriate than I thought. There isn’t any thing I can really watch that is appropriate. And I instantly have to report and block. And some times they disappear and don’t show up again. (Which is what I want to happen.)  Or sometimes it shows up AGAIN! And it won’t go away! And it won’t let me block anyone or silence them. The only nice things in Snapchat are the filters and bit mojos are easy and fun but nothing else really. It just isn’t a good environment for people and mental health it doesn’t help. People talk down on a lot of people on Snapchat and are very mean and rude. In conclusion, I think you shouldn’t get Snapchat if you are looking for something to help you with mental health or inspiration there is a few but compared to all the inappropriate things on it it’s accounted to nothing.",tigerclaw1

When i was 17, I was one of the first people to receive payment from spotlight, a newer feature which at the time paid creators “over a million dollars a day.” I personally know about 30 people that have gotten paid from spotlight. However, for some reason they refuse to respond to me as to why they won’t send me my money that i earned through their platform. If you ever have a problem I hate to break it to you, but snapchat will never physically help you. The only help you will receive from Snapchat is an automated response.

Snapchat,2023-01-07 14:22:46,It’s great but…,4,"When I first downloaded Snapchat I thought to myself, ‘how did I live without it all this time!’ It’s great for memory captures. I used another app for a few years to capture moments and then have a video at the end of that time period which I enjoyed, but now it’s way too costly won’t save my videos after a certain amount. Snapchat is unlimited which is a bonus. 

My only dislike is the Discover section. It’s pointless IMO and should be on a separate page instead of chillin with the Stories so I don’t have to see it. If it were more relevant with real news and interesting stories then maybe that’d be better but otherwise it’s annoying.",DeMoonSta310

Soon, when I told my friends I didn’t have Snapchat anymore, they stoped hanging out w/ me. But overall, I think Snapchat is a great app for sharing stories and chatting with people.

I know this because I don’t know what a shroom or the cart emoji mean nor do I intend on finding out and I only found out about the incident when my friend replied to my story asking what it is which is when I started deleting the snap until my account logged me out and claimed it was permanently locked. I don’t understand how this could of happened since I do not let anyone on my account.

First the reels are the most pointless brain numbing videos I’ve ever seen. I’ll go to TikTok, insta, and FB so I can actually laugh.
The news. I wish if you guys would post so much “news stories” that is wasn’t fake news and false information that can be easily disproved with a google search. I can’t understand why Snapchat makers would want to spread fake news to people who a lot of the time don’t know any better. Be a reliable resource and stop the spread of lies.",CaylaCake4
Snapchat,2022-12-11 23:59:33,Pretty great,4,"One of my favorite apps hands down, I’m on it constantly.

Is this supposed to be funny by switching the genders or do I just look like a man? I don’t know but I don’t really like it.
Another thing is how do I know whether my snap is able to be saved in the chat or if it’s just a one time watch. Sometimes I like to save them because they’re funny or something and it won’t let me but other times it does. I never saw a setting to make it be saved but I wanna know if there is a way..

I absolutely loathe the 3D bitmojis, they’re ugly, and I much prefer the 2D ones that no one has had any issue with for years. 
Just please give us an option to change it back. I respect some people may enjoy them, but they’re genuinely the most ugly designs I’ve ever seen, and they should be not advertised as an option if they’re forced on every user, and we aren’t able to change back.",mang0dragon

That’s a great feature which you opt in for it, but snapchat just chooses someone you watch *sometimes* and then it BOMBARDS you with notifications from them. There’s even an option to subscribe to them so you always get their notifications, but mine is turned OFF. I even used to get notifications from accounts I unadded because i was getting spammed so much. If this doesn’t get fixed i’m just going to delete the app. There is no point for me to keep the app if i turn notifications for the app off all together. The only reason I keep it is to communicate with some old friends, but I do that so infrequently and with notifications off.

Snapchat,2022-11-17 21:56:19,Locked account! 👎 not my fault,1,"I just bought a used iPhone and innocently went to login to my account and all the sudden i get permanently locked account, and they say we can’t do anything about it. Totally unfair I’ve been a user since 2014 and done no wrong the whole time. I’m not returning the iPhone for only snapchat has banned the phone. I got iPhone 13 with battery health 100% for a fair price, but the cost was snapchat. What a joke! Disgrace policy!!!!!! I know a lot of friends that I’m only on Snapchat with now I lost them all and can’t stay connected with them. Not to mention the memories I have saved on my snapchat!!! I don’t know what the previous owner did to get locked but I’m sure that’s something has nothing to do with me, and I shouldn’t be responsible for it and take the penalty!!! I’ve been emailing hope they would do something for me",superwave1
Snapchat,2023-02-26 21:55:22,Snapchat,1,"Snapchat banned my account with all of my memories and everything after i posted a fake 1,000,000,000 dollar bill on my private story🥲I lost all of my memories, all of my snaps, and contact info for so many people i was keeping in touch with. After that , I tried to make a new account and it wouldn't let me. I emailed snap support to get it back and they said it was banned for a "" serious reason"" which then followed up with "" we will not be able to assist you further on this issue."" Now, when i email them they don't answer. I just want my account back and I am making this so other people know the customer service is horrible and also in hopes of snap reaching out to me to appeal to my situation. I love the app, but i just want my memories of me growing up and contact info back for my friends that graduated/moved away.🥲🥲",cheeselover41
Snapchat,2023-01-12 03:21:03,Did not like the new update,5,"i didn’t like the new update, can’t you just leave it the way it was?

I have a suggestion for you and it’s to stop making so many updates you are just damaging the app and making it lose it’s fun. You should start by removing the bitmoji or quick reactions when you replay a story. It’s uncomfortable you can’t see well what’s in the story. You should have also left the tab that said Send a chat the way it was because with the new update you can see the bottomg part of the story it’s uncomfortable and it could have been left the way it already was.",rrodriiii16
Snapchat,2022-12-11 17:07:55,Amazing!,5,"Snapchat is a really good why to communicate with your friends, family and just get to know people! Whenever I'm board I'll just send a snap to my friend and we'll just snap!! You can also make stories from your day and many more! Snapchat is very easy to use! If u want to post something from your camera roll you can do it easily! I also love all of the filters! Which can be good for kids! In conclusion Snapchat is good for kids, meeting new people, talking to people, watching videos, easy to use, make stories and for filters! So for those reasons I would 100 % recommend Snapchat!",five four three two one stare
Snapchat,2022-08-31 12:45:29,Pros and cons,5,"I love Snapchat! However , I really dislike the fact that the conversations disappears which makes it hard for you to remember what you and the other person were talking about if you have to wait hours to respond later. Another con, is that the app alerts you when someone has screenshot something on your page or someone else’s. That’s pretty annoying to say the least. Lol other than that I love the app especially the many different filters and he camera is my go to I never use my iPhone camera to take regular pics to post on other social media sites.",Cah's Mommy
Snapchat,2022-11-22 02:44:05,Make Snapchat Available for all types of IPHONE SE,4,I love this app so much I would always use it to talk to my close friends but earlier this year I was gonna go on the app and then it kept kicking me out and I reset my whole phone for this app to work cause it has all my photos and memories and I kept on re downloading cause I was obsessed with this at AND I MEAN OBSESSED and I was so sad when I was re searching and one of the articles said “Because your phone is too old” like this iPhone SE works perfectly fine and very good quality it’s just the apps don’t allow it to be on the phone. So please Snapchat I’m begging you to re fix your app and make it Available for All IPhone SEs.,ndfswy
Snapchat,2022-09-23 18:39:49,Ads for paid users?,4,"I love snap, I’ve used it for over half a decade, it’s my go to over most social media just for funny videos and pics to my close friends. When they came out with the paid service I said why not, hoping that over time they’d finally remove ads. 
A lot of times when I’m watching subscriptions stories the ads get in the way. 
Is it possible for snap to maybe release a slightly more expensive monthly service to remove the ads? Notably 4 dollars for snap pro isn’t much but I’m realizing I don’t really benefit from having it as it doesn’t add much to my experience. 
Removing the ads would at least make it worth it.",kalebconner1
Snapchat,2022-12-18 05:48:44,Long time user + Suggestions,5,"Hi! I am a long time user of the app snapchat, I think this app is first off amazing and a creative way to make friends! But i do have a ton of suggestions that maybe the app developers could work on! :)) 

Snap Map : 
My snap map has been glitching recently i counted all my friends and I have 1,989 friends and there is only 200 on the map, about 1,500 have there location on. But people disappear in the day after getting offline for 10 min not the regular 8 hours, and it annoys me so much! Please fix that, and fix it so it does not lag out your phone. I would really love to have my snapchat map full! 

Friends : 
Please add so you can have more friends I feel like 6k is a lot and a lot of people try to max out there map and there snapscore and it’s hard with a limit of friends.

Other suggestions : 
More clothes, baggy pants, cargo pants, more of that stuff. More hoodies and just more things! 

Hopefully some of these can get taking into consideration:)",jules5308
Snapchat,2023-03-11 17:58:14,Told to kick rocks by support,2,I have been using Snapchat as my main way of communication for around 10 years now and recently got a new phone with a new number. After trying to log back into my Snapchat on my new phone I realized I needed my old number to get in. I had emailed Snapchats support and was pretty much told to make a new account because there was nothing they could do. I had the email used and even asked if I could give them that or any info about the account to prove it was in fact me. Nope I was told pretty much to kick rocks and that they would no longer be responding to my emails. All the memories I have had for the last 10 years on that account are gone. So yeah Snapchat is great but don’t ever get a new number if you still want your account.,Special_Snowflake34
Snapchat,2023-01-14 05:22:27,January 2023 update,1,This new update is terrible when viewing stories there is a large bold task bar at the bottom that cuts out some of the story as well as regular snaps. You are not able to see the bottom of pictures or stories anymore. Also along with the new black bold task bar the bottom now when you go to click to move over to the stories page you are automatically shown whoever’s story was posted recently. When I go to look at stories I look for certain peoples in particular I do not want to have to automatically have to watch whatever was posted recently. Snapchat please fix the task bar thank you. If there is nothing broken don’t fix it because most of these updates to the physical appearance of the app recently have been terrible please stop fixing things that are not broken,camemory03

We have also seen many others be upset about the ‘BitMoji party’ game get taken down, We politely ask if you guys can please put back up ‘BitMoji party’ and put back up our wins, We hope you guys can understand this and put it back up.

Snapchat,2022-12-01 02:25:36,new update stuff,3,i can not stress this enough but i HATE the new avatar update and how it looks so real. i really really really prefers the animated one where it didn’t look so bad. other than that the app works fine. it’s very hard to log in and out of snap though if the systems down or something. i think there should also be a easier way to get your streaks back because that seems to be an issue that keeps happening. me and a friend will snap each other within the given amount of time and STILL lose our streaks. there is a way to get them back but it’s not guaranteed fully. i just really hope they can change the avatar thing back because i know soooooo many people don’t like that,someone who uses snapchat
Snapchat,2022-10-01 23:10:23,Constant Porn Spam,1,"All I get is ""girls"" adding me asking me to sign up for their onlyfans and sex. I only got this app because my high school friends were using it but I regret that now and should have asked them to just use something else. Also the fact that this is a mobile only app really invigorates me. It essentially traps all your friends so that you are glued to your phone even more because you cannot use anything else. Yes I am aware of the recent web app, but I can't help but think that it was a half baked attempt at making one too little too late. You have to have the app installed onto a device to even be able to login with no other verification option. Not only that, but you cannot open snaps on it even though you can send them from it. I have finally had enough and deleted it. Thanks for nothing.",fpr43

It’s extremely detailed and shows ever imperfection, it’s very different from my regular camera and even my others friends Snapchat cameras.

Snapchat,2022-10-15 11:10:11,Helpful suggestion!,5,"One idea that I think would be super good for the app is to see all our saved audio messages when we press on a persons profile, it would be the same as saving a phone number or looking at every photo on the chat that’s shared between you and the person but there would be a section for audio messages ! And I think that would be really cool, cuz sometimes I’ll miss somebody’s voice when they’re busy and I would really like to listen to their voice messages instantly then have to scroll through all our messages to find them.",chsndhx

Yet these creators won’t go away and I only see the same stories over and over. I adore Snapchat for it’s cute and fun filters I think we all do, as well as how well the texting works. However Snapchat PLEASE remove or fix the discover section because as of now it’s just awful. The only other bad thing I’d have to mention is that calling on this app is a nightmare, you’d be better off using literally any other app to call or video chat with someone.",AtLeastImBeingHonest

I tried to find other alternatives but none would work so I finally got ahold of support after hours of looking for ways to email or text or even call someone. When I emailed I gave a very descriptive and throe story on what happened and the “employee” which is just a bot just told me they couldn’t help and gave directions on how to change my password with the phone number and email which wasn’t on my account I told them I could give them an id or the phone number what was on there but they just ignored me.

There are many things I can do to make this app a lot better though. The stories page is absolutely worthless, and just a means of generating revenue for the company, but everything is clickbait. Also, if I click on the story tab, it should NOT be automatically playing people’s stories without me clicking on them directly. It makes you wonder how that feature got approval from so many people. Nothing should ever pop up on my screen, or initiate unless I specifically click on that item. Get rid of it and maybe it will be 4 stars.",Stiillwoozy

I cant get it back but I don’t understand why your account would be locked for “spamming” when there’s a mute/block button.

Snapchat,2023-01-04 20:18:43,Questionable moderation policies.,3,While Snapchat may be great for communication and keeping up with friends. What it gains in that it lacks in transparent moderation guidelines and very spotty coverage. While my account may be banned permanently for showing gym progress an account that sells sexually explicit content will not be banned or removed for days and weeks. While my account would be banned for something that is not explicitly against terms of service or guidelines. Which greatly upsets me. I hope Snapchat moderation can reach out and make their moderation policies more clear. While I love Snapchat I really feel as if it inhibits Snapchats potential to continue to stay in the main stream of social media which is ever changing and adapting.,Moop.121
Snapchat,2022-11-10 05:12:19,Maybe a good idea For some people,5,So like I had this idea bc idk I just had it anyways I was thinking can you like make an update where we can hide our snap scores like some people can hide their snap scores for the people who don’t want to hide them don’t hide their snap scores bc I feel like this is a good idea tbh because I don’t like people looking at my snap score so I was thinking that maybe y’all can help with this or make this an update and no pressure this app is really good and I like it but that’s just one thing (my snap score) I’m most certain about anyways have a nice day snap chat💗😌,nysayah

I’m obsessed with snap and you can also scroll through videos like TikTok if you go to the play button which is super cool and super easy!

I felt that my character was so accurate to my appearance but ever since they’ve been updated I don’t feel like that’s what I look like and I don’t even want the Bitmoji anymore. I used to have my Bitmoji selfie be the “sick” selfie where your character turns a shade of green but now that it’s updated the green is gone and that was my favorite selfie to put for my Bitmoji. I’m really sad about this update and wish the original Bitmoji design could come back, it would make me feel a lot happier using the app knowing it’s customized exactly how I feel my appearance and mood is.

i tried emailing snapchat support but all i got was an automated email back saying since my account is locked they won’t be able to help me AT ALL. 
this is unfair. i never got a warning or even a temporary lock. i don’t even KNOW WHY i got locked out, and i don’t think i will know because snapchat won’t email me back.

I really like this app, and have been enjoying using it to keep in touch with my friends.

The app is also very easy to use. This makes it for easy to learn for new users so they can hop on and speak with friends easily. This app in general allows for easy conversation  between friends through its free price, story feature, and its easy to use abilities.",@adamtarleton1
Snapchat,2023-02-23 07:09:30,Pretty good for the most part,4,"Snapchat is pretty fun, it’s very convenient to use this to communicate with friends and share photos. It’s also very polished and has a very user friendly interface.

I’ve only had snapchat for about 8 or so months as of writing this, but I’ve noticed some troubling things. There’s a subtle everyday stress of constantly having to keep your streak up, because otherwise it makes it look like you don’t care about your friends. And idk if this is just for me or my group of friends, but it feels dead over time - like 80% of the snaps I get from my friends are just of the ceiling, or a random wall, or their shoulder with their face slightly out of view (I don’t know either).

I have had a few nice memories with this, whether it’s messaging friends, sending each other a picture with a funny face, or messing around with the goofy filters.

I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone who isn’t in high school - simply because it can get addicting, especially when you’re in your tweens.",eiifjsoskfnbsoxpcknsoapxnjeia
Snapchat,2022-12-04 06:07:02,Change The Bitmojis Back To 2D,1,"I’m writing this as of the newest update to the bitmoji’s (the 3D update) and I have to say, if it isn’t broke, do NOT fix it. I do not think I can explain in words just how much I despise the look of the 3D bitmoji’s- they just feel so cheap and downright gross and really take away from the charm of the original bitmoji’s, and I was already on the fence when they first introduced the feature but now? It’s horrible. Having to look at the 3D Bitmoji’s makes me want to delete the app altogether. If you have nothing substantial to offer to the app at all, don’t just introduce some random update to something that didn’t need to be updated in the first place. UPDATE; please for the love of god can you at least add the option to choose whether or not you want the 3d bitmojis or the 2d.
UPDATE AGAIN;
You Made It Worse",Haiiii😜😜😜
Snapchat,2022-12-01 05:56:00,These 3D Bitmoji updates are too much.,3,"Snapchat is a great way to communicate and interact with people, yes, but forcing Bitmoji on people — and ADDITIONALLY forcing them to be the horrendous 3D models — that is too much. If a poll was taken with every Snapchat user, I guarantee over 85% of users would prefer the 2D Bitmoji. I could tolerate the 3D models on one’s profile card alone, but now it’s in chats, stories, profiles, AND Snapcodes? And there is ZERO way to revert to 2D! It’s ridiculous. They are hideous. I almost understand wanting to copy Apple’s Animoji, but oh my god it needs to stop. There isn’t avoiding it anymore, and it makes the app far less enjoyable. Snapchat, PLEASE remove the horrifying and cringy 3D Bitmoji. At the very least, add a way to revert to 2D so we can choose.",NanxQui
Snapchat,2022-10-04 17:58:15,Snapchat ❤️,5,I love Snapchat and I feel like anyone that has never tried it should definitely try it out you could do fun filters you could FaceTime text it’s amazing I love it and it’s such a fun app personally I think it would be better than TikTok because there’s more things to do on Snapchat Snapchat is the most funniest and unique app that I have ever tried and it’s like the best I have a lot to say and this is all true team Snapchat if you read this review and you go try Snapchat out you come back and you think it’s good then write a great review so everyone can try it out❤️❤️,huvycycyvtcg gcgcyctct

My account was RANDOMLY LOCKED PERMANENTLY for nothing!! I didn’t do anything different and I’ve had this account for 10 YEARS all of my friends, family, memories, ALL GONE and no one will help me get it back support won’t unlock it and won’t even look into it. I get automated responses the same everytime I try to get ahold of support no one cares and no one will listen or help the app doesn’t care, makes GIANT mistakes, and refuses to help fix them no one will hear me out.",Niallergirl9820
Snapchat,2022-08-20 09:25:44,I can’t access my bitmoji character,4,Hello! Idk if this is only me but I can’t change my bitmoji clothes. It keeps saying something is wrong and to try again later. Even though I’ve tried many times I still can’t get into it. My Wi-Fi is fine and I’ve even tried using my data but it still didn’t work. So I assume it has something to do with the app but idk. So can you please help me find a solution? Please. And that’s the only thing I have a problem with right now the rest of the app is fine. I’ve been trying for three days now and I’ve decided to finally make a review for help. Ok thank you for reading have a wonderful day!!,HappyMakerw
Snapchat,2022-08-21 02:01:24,Pretty good,5,"So to start, I enjoy Snapchat a lot. Since I'm not allowed to have most social media, my parents allow this one since you basically just talk to friends. It's a great app, simple to use and it makes sense. Although one thing I feel should be added is the ability to reopen your own snaps. Because I have a habit of easily forgetting things, including what I said in my last snap. So if my friend asks me about it or says something, I'll be confused about what they're talking about. I just think it'll be convenient to reopen your own snaps sent to friends.",Dani Tè🥰🤭
Snapchat,2022-11-20 06:18:48,Terrible app never trust,1,You can’t call them and they don’t care about your inconvenience. They don’t care if you lose your photos. They don’t care if you lose your account. They don’t reply to emails about your inconvenience. Nor do they care enough to have any support system whatsoever. They deactivated my account and then temporarily banned me. Then they permanently banned me when i did everything they told me to do to unlock my temporary. Now I’m back to being deactivated. This has been for about 2 months now. I’ve had maybe 5 different account changes because they keep removing and deleting my account and every memorable photo I had to those accounts and now my most recent account is gone. this is Snapchat for you. It doesn’t matter if it takes 1-7 years. They will block your account,jace veenendall
Snapchat,2022-09-25 14:41:30,PLEASE FIX THIS OMG,4,"So, when you select a photo from your camera roll to post it puts an automatic 10 second timer even if it says “no timer” there is a 10 second one unless you edit the photo and change the timer twice then it will fix it. Super easy fix right? No, because when you edit any photo from the camera roll it zooms it in by a lot and basically ruins it. I’ve had selfies and many cool pictures ruined because of this and I’d like people to see it for more than 10 seconds so it’s either leave the timer so it can look normal or have it extremely zoomed so there’s no timer..please resolve this issue..",Shanteshia
Snapchat,2023-02-24 13:02:41,I love this app but recently it’s broken,5,"Recently my snap has been unassigned everyone and making me restart my phone just so it knows what’s going on. Today the big is even worse. I woke up and my snap was fine. I got ready for school and came back to my phone. I went to get on snap to text my friends and there’s no snap on my phone at all. I thought maybe I accidentally deleted it, but going to the AppStore now, it says get. Like I’ve never owned it. Please explain. I’m still getting notifications from snap but there’s no app for me to respond to them from",datgal75
Snapchat,2023-03-15 03:33:52,many things they need to change,2,"First of all, the 3D bitmojis look so out of proportion and weird the company should really bring the 2D bitmojis back . While were on the topic of Bitmojis, they really need to add way more hairstyles, Example: Wolf cut, Emo/Scene cut, shaggy, etc. They should also add a more selection of clothing instead of basic ones, For example add more styles of clothing like emo ecene alternative fairy grunge etc. Same with the hats, there are so many things in the Bitmoji category that should be changed. Now onto when you use your photos to send something it dosent let you scroll back up to the top instead you have to drag the line on the side and it just makes it so much worse. I really hope these things can be added and changed.",cjosfjg
Snapchat,2022-10-29 21:40:22,Ideas,5,I really like Snapchat. It is one of my most used apps and will continue to be especially with new updates constantly coming in. I was also wanting to offer an idea. I like the astrological profile on Snapchat that everyone gets to see and educate themselves just by putting in their birthday. I can read about someone else’s as well as finding compatibility within other peoples signs that I never knew I had. I was wondering if you could maybe go in depth with it more. Maybe putting all of my friends in order of sign and birthdays?,nance1212
Snapchat,2022-11-28 00:28:55,The Utter Disappointment I Have Recently Had With Snapchat,1,"I was an avid snapchat user. For reference my snap score was well over 1 million, so you could say that I was using it as a mainline of communication for me. I also loved how I could store all the memories I have created with loved ones. Recently, my account was compromised and snapchat locked my account. I reached out many times to snapchat support like I was told to, when I would try and log back in. It took 7 tries to finally get a response, and it was so unclear. Snapchat’s support team is NOT SUPPORTIVE. They do not give any information on what happened and their response is “sorry we cannot unlock your account.” I have been stressed and honestly disappointed in how an app with such a great following has the most unsupportive support system I have seen.",Cupcakes240😝
Snapchat,2022-11-13 06:20:59,WORST APP EVER,1,"Snapchat has one of the WORST customer services to ever exist. I have been a loyal member over 6 years, never have I violated or planned to violate a rule. I have never ran into an issue with Snapchat until this situation occurred. I have notified Snapchat support numerous times about my account being hacked and they have permanently locked my account as well as banned my IP address so I could no longer create any accounts on my phone. I have notified Snapchat about this issue too many times only for them to send me the same email stating my account cannot be recovered due to violations of community guidelines. I WAS HACKED, THESE VIOLATIONS WERE NOT A RESULT OF MY ACTIONS, Snapchat does not fulfill their moto at all, instead they receive law suits from mothers concerned about their children, which in fact this is harassment from Snapchat at this point.",nosupport002182800373
Snapchat,2022-09-14 19:46:08,one major issue,2,"I love snapchat. I use it daily and i've had it for years. i've used it as my primary way to save photos/videos , and i would be absolutely devastated if my account got permanently locked and i lost them all , which is what has happened to multiple of my friends who have also had snapchat for years. snapchat needs to fix this issue or give people a way to access “permanently locked” accounts that have been locked for no reason and completely out of the blue. I don't have the time or storage in my phone to go through and save all of my memories , but I'm worried that one day I too will get locked out even though I haven't broken any of snapchats guidelines like my friends hadn’t either. please fix this.",E Spts
Snapchat,2022-08-30 08:11:49,To many adds,1,I absolutely loved this app I use it almost as much as I use texting and I use it more than Facebook messenger or TikTok. Are used to use it to keep up with news until the ads got so frequent that most the time the ads are actually longer than the videos I’m trying to watch. there are way too many ads if I wanted to watch infomercials I would flick on the TV. additionally I’m tired of seeing people I may know because back in middle school I got their phone number and have not deleted it out of my contacts yet. I would not mind paying for Snapchat if that means I saw absolutely no ads as well as seeing only people that I frequently communicate with. I would love to give it five stars but until you fix your app problem it’s going to remain in one star.,Cory Bon
Snapchat,2023-03-22 12:29:17,I love it but please change this,5,So I love the app Snapchat it’s rlly great to interact with ur friends on. But here’s the thing. I had Snapchat for a little while and so did my dad for the family thing but as soon as my dad fingered out about discover and the things on there he immediately told me to delete Snapchat. I rlly hope u guys can add a setting to turn discover off so I can get Snapchat back again. I know there is this thing where u can block or hide that discover but I already saw the front page of it so there is no use on that. Thank you for reading this!,123456789Waves
Snapchat,2022-12-08 23:32:55,Broken,5,I love Snapchat but then one day when I exited out the app like I clicked the home button to go a different but then when I get a noti a few sec later and I go into the app it say my acc has been disabled temporarily and it last for 12hr I I literally do nothing the when the time is up I go on so my streaks and then when I press the home button and try to go back in it say my acc is disabled and this happens ever time and I’m tired of if I I reached out to the moderators and they never respond and also a side affect is that I can’t add or accept friend and friend request.,bgghuvyg
Snapchat,2023-01-28 01:56:25,Does it’s thing (and other things that make me mad),3,"As a quick communication app, it is quick and easy. But I am so sick of ‘Quick Add’ suggestions of people I don’t know and don’t want to. I use the app to communicate with like five family members, and that’s all I want it for. When I click to hide suggested people, they just come right back again the next time I open the app.  So what’s the point of clicking on ‘hide’ if it won’t. I really wish there was a way to just completely turn the function off.

I also hate how close the ‘video call’ button is to the ‘back’ button. I can’t even count how many times I’ve hit video call by accident.  Bad layout design.",Pandoval
Snapchat,2022-08-22 21:22:29,"i like snapchat, just want more actual friends on the app",5,"girls like snapchat so i like snapchat (im a guy by the way) i find it fun to upload pics on there, choose which ones you can favor, save whatever is sent to you in chat threads, use all the crazy and trippy filters SC has to offer etc. i like how you have the availability to type in any word when you look for certain filters. yes some of them are tacky but then again some
of them are wicked in a good way. it does get annoying all the random friend requests i get but that can easily be ignored",Bella's brother Tristan
Snapchat,2022-12-05 07:19:12,Meh,2,"In terms of communication, Snapchat is great and reliable. I wish there would not be such a large influx of ads or other sorts of marketing. I also hate getting story suggestions for people who clearly do not fall in line with the type of content I watch (ie., a big booty influencer when all I subscribe to are news platforms). But the one thing that REALLY drops the cake is the 3D bitmojis. Absolutely awful update and it makes everything look weird. I hate opening up the app to message my friends and seeing the ugly new 3D bitmoji for their icons. Please, Snapchat, if you’re going to do something either remove the 3D option altogether or give users the options to choose between the 2D bitmoji interface or the 3D one. Please and thank you.",cjuarez101
Snapchat,2022-09-22 09:48:03,Suggestions,4,"Absolutely love Snapchat! I’ve been using Snapchat for years and I definitely love all the new features! Although I wish going through my memories was a little more organized. My flashbacks never fully show all the memories from all the years before, causing me to have to search through all my memories. Also I wish there was an option where there were albums for different people such as on google photos. Snapchat is where I take most of my photos. So having a more organized format of all the memories would be amazing and highly appreciated. Thank you Snapchat! 

Best regards!!",shmaddieeexoxo
Snapchat,2022-09-21 03:20:48,Overrated,1,I used to love using Snapchat. I had no problems at all. Then about a month ago I randomly got locked out of my account. I don’t use third-party apps and I know I didn’t violate any community guidelines. Tried contacting Snapchat Support and only got the generic “why we lock accounts” automated response. Fast forward to about a week ago I finally got to log into my account. After a couple days I was logged out and got a message saying my account was temporarily locked. I tried the unlock thing on the website and it didn’t work so I waited 24 hours and was able to log back in. Then after only a day it logged me out again and I got the temporarily locked message again. I’m just about done with this app. I have 5+ years of memories on this app that I can’t get back anymore.,kklingforth
Snapchat,2023-02-14 05:01:56,Love this app!!,5,"I love this app so much, it is a fun and easy way to communicate with my friends and family but there is one thing I feel everyone would appreciate if you added this feature. I feel it would be nice to have a ‘remove from best friends list’ option. This would be useful for maybe broken up relationships where they don’t want to un add each other, or just friends who have grown distant over time. I love this app but I wish this was a feature that could be added. Other then that I see no problems with this app and I love it!!",SnapchatCommenter
Snapchat,2023-04-12 16:43:29,Snapchat is better than facebook,5,If you are trying to find new friends or trying to talk to friends and they don’t have a number you can download snap chat and you can also try filters on snap chat during on a call and if you can’t see your friend cause they moved away you and your friend can download this app and text through it and call through it I recommend this app over face book cause it better than face book for me so I don’t use face book anymore cause I can just use Snapchat cause it is better.,ghvfbhyfgjuyf
Snapchat,2022-12-16 17:23:07,WORST APP AND SUPPORT TEAM EVER,1,"I have been trying for months to get in contact with their support team. They have been absolutely no help and only give you automated support links and no true help. How is it okay to treat your long term members like that? I have been part of the Snapchat community since they made the app, and they won’t address my problem in the slightest. I can no longer access my account and I have no idea why, wasn’t given a warning or any explanation. Just can no longer log in or even create a new account on my phone. I’ve lost years of memories and many relationships. I hate Snapchat now and whoever is behind the app, it’s almost cruel what they have done and if there was some way for me to fight back I definitely would but I have no idea how. Storm the headquarters one day maybe💔.",Godd704
Snapchat,2022-09-06 00:45:28,Permanently locked my account for no reason,1,One day I go to open a snap and I when to send one back and it logged me out so I tried to sign back in and it told me that my account has been temporarily locked so I go to the website and do the “are you a robot” test and I press unlock my account and it sad that my account was permanently locked and that there was nothing that the support team could do about it. The I go to my other account and I when went through the same thing. So I said it’s no big deal I can just create a new account but it won’t even let me do that because my phone number and email are connected to the other accounts!!! They didn’t even give me a straight answer as of why my accounts were deleted. Don’t waste your time on this stupid app like I did.,that kid ivan

But giving it a little bit of Internet access would be a little bit better but it’s something that a lot of people I think should have access to you on Snapchat. I’ve asked it a couple questions just a test it and I think it’s pretty on par for something Snapchat should add on. for people that have certain questions that they wouldn’t ask certain people for like advice or information about a news situation or upcoming information like on stories. it would be awesome for that!",Jenson.Davis

Snapchat,2022-11-28 20:21:51,I like it but I have suggestions,4,I LOVE snapchat it’s a really fun way to communicate and the filters are super fun. I had it for about 2 months and then my parents heard from their friends that snap was bad for kids. They ended up looking at it and saw the discover section ( I never really looked at them ) and there was a lot of mature and sexual content on there so they had me delete it. I think it would be a great idea to have the option of turning off discover and keeping stories. You would still be able to get have discover but you could have the option of turning it off. Just a thought.,AydaLou

Snapchat,2022-09-20 20:31:33,Voice Messages,4,"Good app, but the amount of times I have recorded an audio message, just for my phone to go dim and therefore erase the message, or just for my thumb to barely slip and partially scroll out of the chat I’m in, also resulting in the message being erased, is too many times to count. A suggestion to resolve the inconvenience would be to allow the user to toggle the microphone button, instead of having to hold it down to record the whole message. Just a thought. The messages deleting has got to be the most annoying thing about the app. Everything else is fine. Thanks for reading.",Themcwix

I have tried all the things that people have suggested like shutting down the phone, uninstalling and reinstalling, and checking for app updates. I don’t know what to do anymore and think it might be a restriction on my parents family plan, do you know if family on Verizon can block Snapchat?

Other reviews have said this before… Snapchat support will not contact you back. I’ve not gotten any response from then and it’s been about a month and this is incredibly stupid and frustrating. So, if need help with your account don’t contact Snapchat support, it is a waste of time because they won’t answer you.

I’ve been really depressed lately and I honestly just don’t know if I can take it anymore this just made everything worse. Please Snapchat at least add like a warning or appeal system this is really unfair and inconvenient for a big platform like this.

My bitmoji was still 2D and all of the friend emojis were in the right place. Now my bitmoji is 3D and the chats just don’t look right anymore. I absolutely despise the new look. I hate how freaky my bitmoji looked with her head sticking out and staring at me from the corner of my screen. I hate clicking on my friends profile and having their little character stare into my soul with its head bugging out of my screen. It’s freaky. I don’t like it. My chats look so bad.

Nobody wanted to be a true friend or seek a relationship. It shouldn’t be called Snapchat. It should be called scamchat!

This is very amazing, and I have the potential to make my-self feel perfect, comfortable, etc.  I struggle with body- confidence, and this app makes me feel better Bcuz I DONT have to use my body Nor am I forced to. I text my friends all the time and add all of my family. Tbh, the best part is the Memeoji. 🤩🫶🏼 I decorate it everyday to describe my Personality how I’m feeling, and how u look.

I love being able to communicate with friends. Using the filters, making videos its tuns of fun! I love how when you send pictures or videos it does not save so someone can’t use that as a advantage to you. I think it is awesome because you don’t have to share any of your personal information (unless you want to) so it is safer if you want to chat with people you met online (online dating, online friends etc.).

Snapchat,2022-11-13 15:28:32,Several issues.,3,Great app but I have to rate 3 stars due to some pretty annoying issues. Firstly there is no way to remove friend suggestions in stories. I don’t want to see all these people I don’t know or want to be friends with. Secondly there is no way to permanently disable the awful subtitles. I don’t need them and they’re never accurate anyway. Thirdly and most glaringly I can’t get rid of gambling ads no matter what I do. I unchecked gambling ads in settings but I still get them on almost every story. I report them every time I see them but I continue to be served them. I personally think gambling is disgusting and I very much would not like to see ads for it.,pondwhisker

Until last night when my account was hacked and I got permanently locked out of it. When I tried contacting support through the website, every automated response I got back said that my account was permanently locked and they could not help me. They won’t even look at my support request because it’s locked. What’s the point of support if they won’t help you in circumstances like this? Through no fault of my own my account and all my memories of 6 years are gone forever and I’m being ignored for it. I can’t even call them. Support is only through emails.

You ruined my relationships with people I had on Snapchat that I don’t have by phone number or other social media apps! all my memories/snap photos are gone! All because I clicked the world story and not just my private story too, for the first time ever. You guys are soft, ignorant and I will only be using/posting stories on Instagram now where the 2nd amendment isn’t frowned upon.

Fr tho It’s like a minor detail but it drives me crazy. I really don’t like how everywhere we have our Bitmojis, aside from stickers, they’re starting to be replaced with weird 3D models of them. The one on the back ground of profiles was fine but now my Bitmoji selfie in the top corner along with anyones I click on is replaced with the weird new 3D one. I didn’t spend over an hour designing my Bitmoji in their style until I got it where I loved it on snap just for it to not even be what shows anymore. Idk anyone who likes them. Actually very upsetting tbh. The ones in our profile backgrounds are fine but everything else gotta go man",justfixthememories

But obviously there’s things you need to look out for like sextortion, and random people. I recommend you don’t add people you don’t know but if you do at least try to find there Snapchat account by looking it up. If it doesnt show, DONT ADD THEM! They’re most likely nude bots and will just send you nudes with no stopping. (It’s happened to me before so I avoid that) but be careful with strangers as well (duh).

However, the past few years I’ve noticed how this app have been pushing to show off their public feed by making it take up the entire screen. At first it threw me off but I learned to cope with it, but lately for the past few months I would be shown EXPLICIT content which is down right disgusting and inappropriate for an app that’s used by people of all ages (mainly the youth). There has been countless times where I would report, hide, and would go as far as to subscribe to other content that is more family friendly but unfortunately this broken algorithm would not cooperate with my interests.

It’s now sold out and overrated and I can’t even enjoy the app anymore with how money hungry it has become. I can’t watch but three story clips from a friend without an ad popping up. I tried to watch one of the app’s stories and there were 6 advertisements interrupting a two minute video. I’ve had it with Snapchat, that was my final straw and I deleted the app. Too many ads, too money hungry, too much shock value that they’re looking for. This has become desperate. Filters and sending stuff to friends used to be fun, this used to be ad-free. Not anymore",cszabo444

It is very creepy and it also had access to my story and location which I now turned off but it is just so not right snapchat what the actual.

And I’ve attempted to deactivate my other account but that does nothing to fix the problem.

Snapchat,2022-09-02 21:29:41,Broken!,1,I was permanently locked out of my account I had since high school which deleted years worth of family photos and lost contact with several friends with absolutely no chance at getting it back. I really dont understand why you cant even contact them for another chance which technically think I didn’t even break a rule but they won’t allow you any help or voice about that and i don’t even know what I did wrong so I’m left with no defense basically screwed over with the suspicion that the company is stealing my information. So basically Snapchat was fun at first but it’s obvious they dont care about their customers and will stab you in the back at first chance which says a lot about what they are capable of with private information.,Preston R Smith
Snapchat,2022-08-26 23:51:31,Stay safe!,4,I like the app and would suggest it to many people! The problem is anyone can add you and then if your not careful they can get your location! So what I’m trying to say is stay safe and be careful when you use it! But that’s my one pet peeve well other that some notifications don’t show witch is mildly annoying but if you can get over that it is a good app! I would suggest to be in 6th and up to use it and to add only your friends at first then when you get more into the app you could try adding strangers but I personally wouldn’t till I was way older like 20-21 is like hay I’ll add a stranger.,✨🤭 NO 🤭✨

1: Snap map is really creepy. The fact that people can see where others are is a little weird, even though you can disable the feature, it’s still really weird and a bit dangerous if your not careful. 
2: We NEED the feature where you can remove a lense from any video/photo taken on Snapchat. I have a lot of hideous I wish I didn’t film with filters, as it’s not capturing the reality. I think we need this feature. 
3: I’ve noticed the videos are starting to get laggy over time in my Snapchat camera roll. I don’t know if this is just me, but still.
Overall, it’s an ok app.",Axariahh

And you can track your family if you ever lose them in Walmart 😂😂 but it’s just an awesome app where you can just go allll board. But if someone random sends me a friend request I would say no but sometimes it presses yes but I don’t know where if you save a photo where do you see it that’s my only question really if you could answer that would be greatly appreciated -love Ade,ade fatty
Snapchat,2022-12-01 02:47:13,in regards to the animated characters,2,"I use this app all the time, however my phone just updated and now I have to see those ugly 3d animated characters. It was manageable before when it was only 3d in the profile, but now that it’s the whole app, every bitmoji, I look at, even when i am trying to look at peoples stories, it is ruining my snapchat experience. Please snapchat give us an option to keep the original 2d bitmojis, the 3d are so ugly I literally can’t do this anymore the 3d is creepy, there’s no way to make it look good. The 2d was pleasant and perfect, I beg you bring it back. Animation isn’t always best, as seen with the bitmojis. Who even thought of this?

Lost over 5 years of memories and videos that I had of my kids as toddlers growing up that I’ll never see again. Never thought to back these up as Snapchat has always been great about holding on to these memories for me. Completely at a loss over this, and no there is no way to contact customer support about it once you are locked out.

Snapchat,2022-09-20 01:23:05,a little suggestion…,4,"so i’ve been using snapchat for a while now, and it’s great! i use it with close friends and family as a way to communicate. my younger sister also loves using all of the filters. however, something that i’d love to be added is a feature to make your chats stay permanently. i know that recently there was a feature added that allows them to stay up to 24 hours, but maybe add a feature that allows them to stay permanently! i’d love this because most of the time, if a friend and i are having a conversation about something on snapchat, i like being able to go back and recall what the conversation was about. personally, i don’t have anything to hide and would love if you guys could add a feature that allows the snaps to stay forever without having to keep tapping on the snap to save it; which is what i’ve been doing, but it gets frustrating after a while of having a conversation. but overall, great app! 👻",Queen Elliot
Snapchat,2022-08-30 18:39:44,Literally the best social media app with friends.,5,"Snap is my fav app.
Like dude you create your own character aka ur bitmoji, u can play games with friends using the bitmojis..

U can see ur friends on the map if they share their location and the map is called Snapmap.
You can also post stories on it so that the world can see ur story when they click on the city u're in (on the map)..

There's a tiktok scrolling thing ON SNAP called the spotlight...and...uh it's basically like tiktok.....but on snap •_•

Snap chats are super secured. Like..if you're online on the chat, they can see your bitmoji, if you type they get a notif saying that u're typing, u can replay and save chats and snaps..
Also if you screen record or ss they can know.

Snap is known for doing streaks and using lens and filters on snaps...

There's literally nothing wrong with snap. Everything is literally perfect

Snapchat,2022-08-29 19:40:43,10/10 Recommend,5,love snapchat. #1 reason why I love snapchat is because of the memories feature. this feature allows me to see what I did 2 years ago on this day or 3 years ago and so on. I think it’s such a cool feature and very entertaining. I also love that everything has a 24hr limit. stories can be uploaded for those to see within the 24hr limit and then they’re gone. I like how it’s quick and people can see what you’re doing at that moment. great way to feel connected to those who aren’t close.,den.barnes
Snapchat,2023-04-05 16:51:37,I love snap but this new update… ehhhh,5,"So i’ve been using snap since 2019 and i absolutely love it. but this new update is kinda patchy. first, whenever i post on my public profile story the public profile disappears to where i can’t use it at all. Then, my views don’t all show up. it stops at 4 even tho it says i have more, lastly, when ppl open your messages up their bitmoji glitches and disappears from the bottom corner.

I reported to Snapchat support multiple MULTIPLE times, and even explained the situation. They still refused to let me have access to my account again. This has been happening to many of my family and friends lately, it’s starting to frustrate us. Maybe it’s time we develop an app that Snapchat can’t compete with. Better security, updates, and more.

First, I think it would be SO helpful if you added a feature where when you wanna un add people, you can click multiple people at once, so if you wanna unadd a lot of people you can select the ones you want to un add and when you finish clicking all of them you can click one button to un add them.",aria Zeiner

I have shut off the feature of quick add and I still get this list of random people that I can add. This is a highly unfavorable feature if we have young teens that we want to keep safe from those that prey on children.

Snapchat,2023-02-24 23:54:33,Recent update,1,"Newest update has made the app harder to use. Cannot swipe to see conversations and defeats the “accessibility” purpose of the app itself. Snapchat used to be a quick way to contact friends/family, now has been turned into another form of social media instead of a quicker/easier way to message. Restricting the “swiping” forces you to your “friends map” instead of entering a conversation. It forces you to tap buttons instead of easily swiping left/right. This technology has now been taken away for “improvement”, when in reality has taken 5 steps backwards. This recent update has completely ruined the whole purpose of snapchat in the first place, a quick and easy way to speak to anybody. 0/10 update. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!",HarrySchaft347

The 3-D would be fine as an option for people to choose, but I have never wanted it to be my default and likely never will. It’s a real shame that they’ve set it up this way.

Like why??? Why can’t it just be the people that you left on opened. Also let’s say you want to snapback everyone but exclude someone- good luck you can’t (even if you pressed on “more friends”) 
Fix this before I lose it even more haha.
Thanks",extraxexxx

Right now its based on time/location, but can you make it so the feature searches based on captions as well? For example if I type the words in it wont necessarily take me to the memory, but provide a list of memories with those words in the order of similarity. I'm not a tech person so I'm not sure if that takes really complicated coding, so apologies if it does, but that would be cool.",elaine.pickle
Snapchat,2022-08-30 22:58:46,Why I gave snap(Snapchat)five stars,5,Now for me it have been great I haven’t had no problems with it The reason why I kinda like it is because if you don’t wanna give nobody your number you can give me their Snapchat and you still talk to them and you can still connect to other familyI hope you make new friends like if you don’t make friends in person you can always add a friend on Snapchat and you can make friends with them even though it could be dangerous by the kind of people yo are talking to.,Alex83832

My favorite thing about Snapchat was the game icon where you can play games with your friends, relatives etc whenever times. And seeing that it’s recently removed truly hurts me 😔 I have been collecting tons of stuff and un locking things in games and now that it’s gone snap chat is just boring.

You have bad customer service cause I’ve sent out more than 10 emails with no responses. When I did get a response I responded and got no response after. This app is okay ! But the issues that come with it is annoying because, there’s no way to speak with anyone for the issues to be resolved. All I know is that I’d like to get my account back thank  you.

I am aware the 14 Pro Max had issues in third party apps however my phone is up to date and so is my Snapchat app. The focus works great on Instagram, so it must be a bug on snapchats end.

Snapchat,2023-01-31 09:11:10,About the Snapchat +,3,Well I think since we paid for the Snapchat + we should be able to add a lot of friends as much as we want without restrictions and also we should be able to privatize our public account just incase we don’t want other people seeing them . And we should be able to pin more then 3 people maximum 5 since we paid for this . But the money we paid for the app we aren’t seeing the benefit we only get badges wallpaper And story. Atleast make us want to pay more . I am not encouraged at all And I hope y’all look into this . Even if you wanna charge $25 if its a cool feature people will surely pay,Olexzziinooo

What fueled this one-star review however was the amount of spam I was getting. So many bots sending friend requests, and if you accept it they spam you with nsfw videos and scam links. And in the notification setting there’s no way to turn off email notifications, so my email was getting spammed with bot friend requests at all hours.

The only information I could learn from its subpar article about this was that it's nonexistent customer support couldn't even fix this. Even if I did do something wrong and I wasn't aware of it I deserve an explanation, and being suddenly banned from the app and not being able to talk to a human being about this shows that this company is low maintenance and does not care about its community.",A13x 4302

I can’t clear the cache because I have to open my settings for that, yet the app crashes before I can even open settings. When the new update came out 6 days ago I was excited that they’d finally fixed the issue. But no. It’s still crashing.

Snapchat,2023-02-15 21:06:30,No more games😭,2,I first got the app in December and it was great. I loved racing my friends and was a good way to pass time. I posted stories and added new friends. The problem started in late to early February when animal restaurant wasn’t available. We had to go back to previous sessions and click on that. Soon the entire list of games disappeared entirely. I’m upset and spent so much time and progress on those games. So therefore Snapchat isn’t rlly that fun anymore. You can get it but just know the games are gone and there is no point in looking for them. Hopefully Snapchat will come to their senses and revive the idea of games.

It is fun to use different filters in the app but sometimes it does lag but all apps do that to so I do not see the problem with that. My friend had a big library of photos and videos but Snapchat lagged and all of her stuff disappeared when they got back on. They did recover some of it but not much and that is a only one of like 10 flaws that happen. But it is really a fun app but you do need to update it.

Like custom sticker albums. Many people use the sticker tool to add memes to use when something happens, but when you have to much, like me, it gets hard trying to look through them all to find the perfect reaction sticker.

However, one thing i noticed that I don’t particularly like is the reels section. Yes, it’s not in ur face, but i wish there was an option to turn them off so it’s purely for communicating and not a rip off of Instagram. I don’t like the idea of reels, but like every other teenager, it draws you in and I’ve tried so many times to quit, but since I’m on Snapchat so often I have to restart it. Other than that, I love this app.",s.j.ana
Snapchat,2022-11-07 00:14:53,Olivia dumbi,5,"I love snap so much it helps me snap my friends and call them. And while ur on the call u can be doing the snap filters , super fun I love it. And snap really helps me bc I don’t have a phone number neither do I have a SIM card so instead of getting one I can go on snap and be able to call text and more. And also snap sends u a good amount of notifications witch helps me remember to check my snap if someone snapped me called me or texted me . Thanks snap people for making things a lot more easier for me❤️",olivia dumbi
Snapchat,2022-08-31 18:51:58,Personal Social Media,5,"SnapChat is a great way to either get close to your friends or, if you’re already close, get closer. You can share pictures, links, chat, etc individually or in a group. SnapChat also has a way to interact with others too. Like posting on your story or reacting to someone’s story by messaging them. The app also auto deletes pictures and chat, so it’s a great way to communicate with others and not have to go back and delete stuff that takes up memory.",KathyH26
Snapchat,2022-10-04 21:43:45,Locked out,2,"Snapchat has been my primary method of communication since 2014. Recently, I got out of a nasty relationship with a narcissistic abuser. He decided to report my account which lead to me being temporarily locked on Snapchat. Snapchat refuses to speak to me other than an automated message. I have never had a problem until now. I did not get an email saying I had done something wrong, I was just immediately locked out. It said I could get back in after 24-48 hours. It’s been a week. Today, I managed to log in and successfully unlock my account but after 5 minutes I was kicked out and locked again. If someone could help me, I would appreciate that.",Marie.Reag

First when you try to snap someone it might send to the wrong person, or it might not send at all. Then when someone snaps you you might not receive it on your end. Also sometimes when i go on this app it will say that i’ve never snapped anyone and just line up how i have added my friends. Therefore i have to leave the app and refresh a few times before it works correctly. Overall there are many problems and please fix this!!",awesome super nice

Also Bring back the 2d bitmoji, they were fine before now they look atrocious. There should be an option to choose. There also should be an option to choose to have tiles on, tired of having these brain rot discovery tiles with celebrities and pure garbage being shoved in my face just because i have snapchat, you should at least give users the option to disable it. some of us don’t wanna see the brain rot they’re trying push on people especially kids now. it’s ridiculous way over sexualized content that shouldn’t be allowed on this terrible platform.",Thelovelyfate

I believe this to be because my ex-boyfriend logged in on his account from my phone months ago and he got his account permanently locked maybe a month ago. I think this is very unfair to me that I got my account disabled. Snapchat does not want to hear anything and are not helping me through this process. They straight up told me they would not be continuing this conversation. Many people log onto their account from another phone, I think the account and primary phone should be restricted not someone’s else’s account and another phone.

Snapchat,2022-08-22 04:14:20,Clickbait everywhere,1,"I’d say over 50% of all video titles on that app are hugely exaggerated and not true at all (along with being inundated with ads every five seconds). They try to trick you into clicking. It’s very unethical. I just avoid clicking on 99% of channels because almost every time I end up saying “why did I just waste my time clicking on that?”. Now I’m aware of the social media trap. I just hope others can see how crumby this app is too. They could be about quality (and a few channels on there really do put out quality news and content), but seems like they choose to settle mostly for garbage videos.

Every time I have logged onto it there would always be a “something went wrong, please try again later” and when I would text I wouldn’t get a notification from snap then they texted me back. Then this morning I opened snap and nothing worked at all, I tried resetting my phone and using only my WiFi and everything but it still never worked. I deleted it and redownloaded it and now it won’t let me even long into my account and all it keeps saying is there is something wrong with my internet and please try again.

Snapchat,2022-11-15 00:05:43,Horrible,1,I’ve had snapchat for at least 6 years and only have minor problems but never had a horrible problem until recently. My account was permanently locked out of no where with now explanation. I’ve sent so many messages to the support center for help because I don’t know what happen and I have sentimental photos and memories with relatives who no longer here. And have explained that. Anything I say or try Snapchat reply’s with a link of the violation guidelines. They don’t tell me what happen nor give my account back. The account is still there but is locked with no access to it. Snapchat has constant bugs on the app too that I have had but taking my account without reasoning is insane and unfair.,aimee melendez

Snapchat,2022-09-21 16:14:27,Banning Accounts for No Reason,1,"So like many other people I’ve found online, I was another victim of getting my account banned for no reason! At the very least snapchat could tell you their reason but they do not say why you were banned. My phone was device banned out of the blue and a few days after getting a new phone it happens again to my account. If Snapchat support could at least share reasons why or have a decent support system to help those of us in this situation that would be great! Instead it’s just an automated service that doesn’t answer any questions and greatly frustrates all trying to get help. It’s completely unethical as a company to not provide any support for their products.",anonuser294757391
Snapchat,2022-09-18 18:08:47,FIX THIS,1,"Yo Snapchat. 
Instead of flat out banning people for adding one too many accounts,

Make it to where you can add a certain amount of accounts per day. 

Once you reach the max account per 24 hours, you have to wait 24 hours to add again. 

Make it where you don’t get banned for adding people.

Only the cool down. 

This is customer dis satisfaction. 

You are letting your customer down. 

Fix this issue now. 

Seriously. 

There is no reason why my entire friends list that takes me MANY hours to make, 

Get wiped away for virtually no reason. 

It can simply be solved by having a cool down. 

No banning. 

It’s seriously lame and insecure of you. 

Fix the problem now. 

With all these weekly updates you have you can update this is one week. 

0% banning for adding.

24 hour maximum. Then you simple cannot add anyone until the cooldown is complete. 

“You’ve reached your maximum amount of adds for today”

When you try to add you get that message and it simply doesn’t go through. 

If you click add again you don’t get banned, it simple doesn’t go through.

All for no reason! She has reached out to support with ABSOLUTELY no help or response!  She even tried making a new account on a different device but my guess is they have the IP banned as well cause she was able to use that one a couple days and now guess what!?!?!?

If Im paying you for a premium subscription, why are you still showing me ads. That’s ludicrous and y’all know it. Can’t even view stories without seeing 200 ads. This app use to be really great, especially before all the advertisements. Now it’s just an ad-watching simulator. If I pay for premium there is ZERO reason I should be seeing ads. Y’all literally that money hungry you’re gonna take my money and still make me sit thru an add that pays you like .005th of a cent. Thank you snap, I will be cancelling my subscription to y’all and would never recommend this app to anyone.",debbieann79
Snapchat,2022-10-21 05:07:01,Eh,3,"I’m noticing that the ads have become ridiculous to the point where I will no longer be using the app fully until the ads are toned down. I am literally experiencing more ad view time than content view time and so therefore I will not be using the app for anything other than communicating with friends no more using spotlight, or looking at contact creators stories, just mine and my friend’s stories alone. Learn to make the ads less prevalent and only present the first few minutes when launching the app and not closing it due to the frequency of use being greater than any other app.",Cole Kindred
Snapchat,2022-09-09 03:40:30,Short Ads,5,"One great thing i notice with this app which I think other apps should follow is that their ads in the reels are super short and you’re able to skip most of them if you want. And if you happen to like the ad for the product you’re watching, you could obviously watch the whole thing. Good for advertisers and users. The advertisers don’t annoy potential customers with long drawn out ads and consumers have the freedom to not have to watch if they don’t want to.",JoeyRedEyes

Snapchat,2023-03-15 21:41:27,Unbelievable how many ads are on the app nowadays,2,If you open up the app and look at a few stories you get an ad another few stories ad. Then if you look on the discover section where they offer little news stories or various things in the explore tab every single one of them has so many ads. Almost after every single slide you get an ad. Look I get that they’re a for profit company and the app is free but I don’t have time to see a news story that I think is cool and should take 3 minutes to look at only to be stopped by ads and have to spend 15 minutes. News flash I’ll just close the app and stop using it.,Mckobee

It says read the guidelines and see if you did anything wrong or downloaded a 3rd party app, never did and didn’t do anything wrong. Y’all say email snap support and I did but the email they sent back does not help at all. I’m guessing I got hacked but yall locking my account that I have had for 4+ year is crazy.",kellen duff
Snapchat,2022-11-05 05:52:31,Not as good as before,2,I’ve had Snapchat for 6 years now and I’ve never had a problem until all the new updates have come up this past year. Snapchat plus is basically their version of Onlyfans which is unnecessary and useless. The subscription fees are ridiculous as if you don’t already have to pay for every little thing and they just want your information. The so called big fixes are a joke because it still crashes when you least expect it. I just wish they didn’t have to make things complicated and leave the OG Snapchat as it was. I’m very disappointed and won’t be using the app regularly anymore.,Arri the Baddie

I’ve turned off my location completely in the app to fix that part, but as for the rest, I don’t know what’s going on. Even when I create a private story and select only certain people to view it, my whole friends list views it. I don’t understand why it’s like this and it bothers me. I don’t want strangers seeing my story 24/7 or being to chat with me! & yes I have the settings set on the opposite! (As only friends can chat with me see my story)",notabasicbih

But last time it did, it let me back in. Im not doing ANYTHING WRONG with my snapchat. I have no third party apps, no spams, no unsolicited texts and i barely even post. So im not understanding why my snap is being locked. And I cant reach anybody for it because “snap team cant help”, but years of memories are gone because of something im not even doing?",jessxo2001
Snapchat,2022-09-21 13:31:54,Shutter sound!!,4,Honestly i love this app so much but one thing that bothered me so much since day one was that the only way to turn off the shutter sound was to flip the silent switch. Another recent thing is the new UI which is terrible and not gesture friendly which is kind of disappointing because Snapchat has always been this minimalistic gesture based messaging platform and now it’s just complicated with buttons all over. Please bring back the previous UI or at the least add a setting to turn off the camera shutter sound!!,kjarkasy
Snapchat,2022-08-31 00:29:17,Fav app,5,My favorite app on it 24 seven I literally love it I can talk to all my friends that have it and if you have a friend that doesn’t have it ask them to get it so then you guys can chat and you guys can feel more comfortable and it’s free and you can watch videos on it you can share stories with your friends you can show where they are and you’ll never have to be lonely because they’ll get a notification on their phone and I’ll open it and then Wala there you are!!!!!😘,Layla with the sailor

A friend of mine just texted me to say that her account was permanently locked. She received no warning, had no idea this was going to happen, and has been given no opportunity to appeal. Every time she tries to email them, she gets a form letter response basically saying that it’s her fault and that Snapchat support will not help her. This is awful customer service, a disgusting way to handle business, and frankly, a ridiculous policy. She lost all of her photos and contacts that she had on the app and has been told to just deal with it. Absolutely shameful.",dkCiel
Snapchat,2023-03-19 01:13:00,Great App,5,I’ve been using Snapchat on and off for years now. It’s great at sucking people into continuing their usage of the app. Through snap maps where you can check friends locations. And best friends lists that show who your true best friends are.

Like your location or when you take a screenshot, I know there’s probably settings to turn that off but if a kid or if someone who wasn’t aware of these things used the app then it could be a major privacy invasion. There’s lots of bots and it’s hard to navigate. Then all the content is completely brainless and even if it wasn’t, you can’t see it again. Maybe that’s the reason the content is so bad, cause it’s erased so quickly. Parents, don’t let your kids use snap and because of all the porn bots and even more concerning, you don’t want strangers knowing your kids location just because kids don’t know how to change the settings.",Camille Vazquez

I feel like if I’m paying for + that we should also see but just how many times a snap story has been replayed but WHO replayed it and how many times they replayed it! Just a thought for the next upgrade!

Now I feel like I wasted my time and money on my vacation because I can’t even get MY pictures from Snapchat , my only option to “share” is to just post the snap. Wasted my time and I can’t even screen record my videos because of how much Snapchat has the editing tools in the way of my video.

I love looking through the clothing and trying it on. Snapchat WAS an amazing app until one day I woke up to check my Snapchat. Something looked off. IT WAS THE NEW UPDATE. I do not use that app anymore because of how horrendously ugly the 3D bitmojis and profile pictures are. Until you change them back to 2D me and many others will not be using your app. It’s so ugly.

The big grey bar below the screen when watching a story you’re watching is annoying. Not only does it block the close caption, but why do I need a bar telling me to view profile to something I’ve already subscribed to. I think it needs an option to remove it from your screen cause I can already tap the profile name at the top left screen to view their profile.

You should be able to view the stories of any person who has firm request you before you add them back even if they are set to private. by them sending you a friend request they are already acknowledging that they want you to see their stories and be their friends. that way you can determine who a person is before adding them and letting them has access to your story.

Snapchat,2022-12-25 17:53:59,My Opinion on Snapchat,5,"Snapchat is such an amazing app cause it is so fun to get to talk to all of your friends without having to FaceTime or call through phone cause it has both and all the filters look so amazing I specifically recommend the devil horns one it’s so cute and make you look AMAZING and if not you get some funny filters as well. I also love that you get to make your own avatar and you have so many options and colors to choose from, I recommend downloading Snapchat",Libra_8762
Snapchat,2023-02-13 00:29:54,Not a fan of the “random” memory tab,1,"I really enjoyed only the yearly memory reminders because it gave some time to grow and forget about the past. Now with the monthly/random memory reminders it kind of hurts. 

My cat died barely a year ago and I needed time to heal. I promised not to look at the videos of her before she was put down until it comes up in my “one year” memories. By then I promised myself to be properly healed. If I wasn’t properly healed by then I would be ready for it. I would have my other cats to comfort me and have a safe place to cry about it.

Being in a random place and a random time to just check out my memories and in the “random” tab I just see that is not something I expected. (Especially before going into a party, my mood was down)

 It would definitely be better if these annoying random tabs didn’t exist. Not only is it annoying because it shows random moments that happened not too long ago but some memories that it would be nice to see when things have changed. Too look back and see a difference in life.",mashpotash
Snapchat,2022-09-12 05:15:36,This is a great app,5,There’s so many filters you could be so many different things you can make so many different videos you could you could follow people you could watch their stories you could have all this fun on it and you can make your own story you can make your own avatar it’s the best thing ever you should buy this app because if you don’t I’m gonna cry oh Innosphere Lauren Z side please make Alexis Merritt one of your friends please because I’ve followed you for so long,;&-$9!6:4)|.
Snapchat,2022-11-10 17:33:07,Suggestion for group chat,4,I don’t really understand why the creator of the group chat can’t kick/remove people from the group chat and have to instead make everyone leave and then make a new group chat if said person refuses to leave the chat. Like recently I have made a group chat and had added someone to the groups chat and they started spamming messages and when they were told to stop they continued so I had to create a new group chat and add everyone back and tell them to leave the previous one.,BC__٩(ᐛ)و

I don’t quite know what’s wrong with it and it won’t work I’ve tried deleting and re-downloading it and everything I can think of nothing seems to work and I don’t know what to do about it I think there may be a bug in the system.,peone420
Snapchat,2022-08-24 07:16:11,Bans,1,I know a lot of people have come across the problem of being permanently banned on Snapchat without explanation or warning. By far unfair and is extremely discouraging to give the app a good rating when their support system is just a robot. Please fix this or Atleast add a feature allowing to appeal bans. I just moved I to college and the main form of communication is Snapchat. Without that I feel isolated and away from everyone else. It is also the main form of communication from my distanced girlfriend. Snapchat has done great things for me but this is out of hand.

Snapchat,2023-04-16 02:54:30,Good but could use some additions,3,"First of all, I like Snapchat, it's a good way to communicate with people and keep up with them. It has an uncomplicated interface and overall is a great app. However, it could use a few more things, or additions to already existing features. For example, there should be the ability to reply to comments on Spotlight videos. Also, I feel like there should be more selfie options. There are some, but not quite enough, in my opinion. Other than these few things, the app is great, works well, and I haven't encountered any bugs yet.",Crazy_Gamer_Girl

During that process I tried to delete Snapchat because I thought it was the only app that wasn’t working. Once I finally turned off my phone and turned it on again, Snapchat wasn’t downloaded to my phone. I went to the App Store and tried to download it again but it won’t let me. Ive been trying for MONTHS to fix this since most of my memories and pictures are on Snapchat from the last 7 years or so, including people, I talk to regularly on Snapchat with no other communication.

The games were one of the best things about snapchat if i’m being honest, if made it easier to communicate with friends even though you aren’t always necessarily talking. Me and my friend played these every night and we were both upset due to the absence of the games. I feel as though you should bring them back. Not for snapchat + but just in general. The games are great and it is disappointing that they are gone now.",potatowoman75

Snapchat,2022-11-17 07:29:20,Confused,1,I have had this app 8 years I go to check my snap and I see that I’m logged out I try to log back in and my screen says that I’m locked out I click the link I read and follow the instructions to unlock my account only for it to permanently lock my account. As I was confused I go to log into my boyfriends account on my phone and I get his account locked all because once you get permanently locked they ban  your ip address so not only is my account with all my Memories and pictures  gone so are his. all we want back is our pictures. We tried to download data but nothing. Snapchat also doesn’t tell you why your account is being locked just locks it .

Snapchat,2022-09-18 17:02:18,Glitch,5,Snapchat keeps glitching where my snap flashback won’t update from the day before. Like it’s currently the 18th and it’s still on the 17th. Or sometimes it won’t show any flashbacks for that date but if I look back in my photos I definitely have pics from those days so idk why they’re not showing up. They’re not photos I would hide from showing up as a memory again. Both of these instances have happened multiple times.,~54321~

She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower. For her true love and true love's first kiss.

Snapchat,2022-09-12 12:25:16,Snap Streaks are Ingenius,5,"What better way to bring some real order and routine to your life than to dedicate a portion of your day to sending at least one snap a day to your buddies!

My life was in shambles. I felt like failure, like I couldn’t do anything right. I always felt like my parents hated me, like my friends secretly wanted me to just die. 

But snap streaks saved my life. I could rest easy, knowing that I had amassed the discipline to always, always, always send streaks, no matter where, when, or how. Finally, I could be useful, at least at one thing! 

Even on camping trips, I would hike for 30 minutes at a time to get a meager one bar to send streaks! I would sit there for hours, sometimes having to restart as a cloud would fly over me and block the reception!

Thank you, Snapchat, for giving my life some meaning and purpose!

I have been using snap chat since 2017 
It was popular back then, I remember all my classmates back in high school had a snap chat. Unfortunately, this app has changed a lot, especially since you guys added “so many” advertisements, in 5-10 minute long videos in snap chat it has like 5 different advertisements don't you guys think that's a little bit too much? I know you guys are earning a lot from it but what about us? We are wasting our time watching all of these ads to continue seeing a video from snap chat! No wonder a lot of people stop using snap chat. I remember back in 2017 it hardly had ads but now you guys added way too much it's ridiculous!",Kaboom29

With as much negative fuss that it’s caused - me being one of the people that doesn’t like it (like, at all) - I don’t think it’s right to force the change on everyone without at least an option to revert it back to it’s original 2D version. So if there’s any way possible to add a feature to turn the 3D on or off, please be working on this! I can guarantee it will make a huge amount of Snapchat users happy with the app again. 😌🤙🏼",MCWhite823
Snapchat,2022-10-08 16:12:31,Buggy and completely locked out,1,"I have been using Snapchat for years now and up until the release of the most recent update 5 days ago, hadn’t experienced any problems. After downloading the update for Snapchat my account has been temporarily locked according to the app but permanently locked on the official Snapchat unlock site, along with the fact that I can’t create a new account. After a day the account will unlock but the moment the app closes or my phone turns off it signs me out of Snapchat and locks my account all over again. This hasn’t happened before until I downloaded the latest update. Still recommend Snapchat but beware of the bugs",Blackjack7510
Snapchat,2022-08-30 02:26:58,Great App,4,"Snapchat is a great app I use it everyday. There are so many different features, it’s really becoming an all in one app! Which I love. I would have given it 5 stars although there are a few things I would change. I wish there could be ways of saving the various things to watch, because they can get lost easy. I also wish that there was more of a variety of things to watch instead of having the same stuff come up. Over all it’s a wonderful app with some slight changes in need.",samiwesr2d2

Quit sending them. At least let us turn them off. They happen way too often. Also, quit promoting Snapchat on the computer or whatever. I’m constantly seeing that pop up above my messages and I’ve closed it countless times. I obviously don’t care about it. Get the hint or implement something to “Never show again”.

Notifications for screen record, and screenshot if the conversation is concerning or threatening and you need to ask someone for help you legit can’t because you will get a notification for it 😡 so one thing is that this app needs improvement on is “PrIvAcY” because there’s old man and children on this app 🤷‍♀️ well that’s all for now bye Snapchat! 😨🫵😭🥺🤣🤷‍♀️🙄😡",chakrikaada5265
Snapchat,2023-01-15 20:47:31,So buggy,2,The update is so buggy. I see stories automatically now and I hate that I can’t see who is coming and swipe next if I don’t want. I hate that I have to view whoever’s story is next when it’s on the lower screen and I can’t just go to the story page. I hate the the app is showing me muted stories now like I muted for a reason they can see who sees their stories and who doesn’t watch everything so please don’t automatically show me stories I don’t wanna see and especially don’t show me muted stories either it’s gonna cause problems. Just terrible honestly and you k ow what I really hate the new Bitmojis they’re ugly and scary looking.,AMPilz
Snapchat,2023-01-11 21:11:48,Horrible app.,1,The app is mid at best. It is easy to talk to people on it but there are so many minor inconveniences like best friends list. I have people on there i don't want there but don’t want to unadd. Another thing is that the app gets worse and worse with every update the developers don’t listen to community feedback and just do their own thing. There is the ugly 3d Bitmojis now and I open snap today and there is a huge taskbar at the bottom of a snap that serves no purpose as opposed to the old one. I really don’t like the app and if I didn’t have almost 5 years of memories saved and everyone else didn’t use it as their main form of communication I would have deleted it years ago.,gdhdhdjdhf
Snapchat,2022-12-07 03:56:50,It’s a really good app to use!🤍,4,I like this app because you can take pictures and stuff like that to send with your friends with filters. But I have a couple problems to share with number 1 when I first made an Snapchat account it said camera need so i just restarted my app to not see that anymore but it won’t go away so I just looked up ways to fix that and I did I just needed to restart my device and open settings again I hope that works guys! If you have the same problem!☺️🤗,i prefer not to.

Snapchat in general is a pretty disgusting app and should have a permanent age filter on it so kids can’t accidentally download this crap and see all those “news” stories. It’s not okay.",Jfvdnfdkisbvsdjb
Snapchat,2022-11-17 16:29:52,start warning people before you permanently lock their account.,1,"The same as I’m seeing other people have reviewed, Snapchat likes to lock people out of their accounts and not give them any access to the countless years of memories that they had. Never got any response, they don’t care about the people that use their app or they would fix this and actually look into why an account got locked. It’s been two months and I still can’t get over it. I have 7 years of memories I’m no longer able to look at, a lot of which are people & pets who have passed away or pictures of things I needed for something else and can’t have access to.

 Over all this app is great! I have fun communicating with my friends, because it is easy, and I love the filters! There is such a verity of ways to talk to people. call, text, or even a group chat or call. I love this app and I think you’ll like it too!",Freddy_13562
Snapchat,2022-10-29 22:38:27,It’s a very nice app just one thing,4,This is one of the main apps I use. I use it to talk with my friends. I recently had to delete it though because it would only work like once and then I would have to power off my phone and try again. I have re downloaded it and it says check your connection and try again later. I have tried it literally everywhere and It does not work. Other than that inconvenience it’s a very great app and would recommend if you are interested.,SkatingShuriken
Snapchat,2023-01-10 07:48:10,Unable to even make an account on my phone,1,"My snap acc was wrongfully permanently locked- saying I had gone against the terms and conditions (i didn't). So my only choice was to permanently deactivate if (i thought it had been hacked). So then, I went to create another only for my snapchat to tell me ""Due to repeated failed attempts or other unusual activity, your access to Snapchat is temporarily disabled"". Not only did I not attempt ""many times to log in"" but also, it seems it's only on this device I cannot make a new account. But I'm not gonna go get a new phone because my ip was black listed--- so I was like I'll just wait, but many people say this message never went away. What do I do??",TheMagesticMangooo

And now I can’t even pin people anymore without getting snapchat+ for $40 a year. Filters were and always have been cool, and I hate that instagram and others stole stories, but adding the spotlight and putting random internet people on my feed is the “snapping friends and family” thing snapchat was always supposed to be.",El;žabeth

Notion,2021-11-26 23:16:50,Love the vision. UI and UX needs work,4,"Let me just say first and foremost, ever since I got more used to the learning curve of using this app and taking notes and honestly trying to put everything I possibly can in there to prevent me from having to write things down in different notebooks and writing notes in my default notes iPhone app, I love it, but sometimes it can be sooooo frustrating.

One example is the highlighting. You cannot select lines of text, just single lines. Another thing is that when you highlight a word or line sentence to change it to a header or a body paragraph or even just a sentence highlighted in yellow, you can’t get rid of the little options box that pops up when you start highlighting. I have to hit back and then go back into my page to make it go away. These kinds of things make the app so much less efficient and quite frustrating but because I can organize so well on it, especially sermons and lesson notes, I’ve held onto and really use it for almost everything.

If they improve those things it can result by an amazing app. Your team is always free to email me if you guys want more support tickets haha and ideas for improvements. I’m a graphic designer myself so I just see how things could be better.",TrustedReviews!
Notion,2022-03-25 16:26:06,"Great potential, but buggy and lacking essential features",3,"I feel that the iPadOS version of notion is a dumbed-down version of the MacOS version, with many features lacking that people have been asking for for the past several years, and that make the app completely unusable for me on the iPad, forcing me to switch between different apps to accomplish tasks that would normally be done within Notion on the Mac. - The font size is way too small on the iPad, and there is no way to change it. The app doesn’t allow CMD +/- to increase font size, which has been one of the most voted requests on Reddit - You cannot have multiple windows, which is a MUST-HAVE for me to work. When I contacted their support, they suggested opening several windows in Safari. If that’s the solution, what’s the point of having an iPad app in the first place? - You can’t copy several paragraphs in a page. If you select multiple paragraphs, it’s impossible to copy/paste. Absolutely impossible. A feature that any iPad app has, but Notion doesn’t! I can go on, but my advise is for the company to take a look at the Reddit forums and user feedback, and start prioritizing what people have been asking for for years over what the company keeps adding to compete with similar apps. In other words, please prioritize the user experience over features.",akhella
Notion,2021-03-03 20:21:17,AMAZING productivity tool but needs an offline mode desperately,3,"I absolutely LOVE Notion and it has allowed me to streamline my note-taking and record-keeping habits and allowed me to use the same tool for so many things where my workflow used to be fractured across multiple apps- it’s truly incredible software. I love the creativity of both the Notion team and the community of users they have fostered. Being able to share templates with one another is wonderful and the functionality of the app is tremendous. However, as much as it pains me to say it, the outages Notion has been experiencing has shaken my confidence in the software since I have really come to depend on it and, when the system is down, I can’t access any of the critical information I store there. I am so impressed by what the Notion team have developed but if these outages continue to happen and we don’t have the ability to save our data locally, I will have to find another solution because I can’t afford to be locked out of the data I store on the platform. I hope the Notion team is working on an offline sync, and if they are it would be so helpful for us users if they would share that information and give us a timeline. Much appreciation to the Notion team for all of they’ve done. I definitely recommend the app unless you can’t afford to be unable to access your data from time to time.",1ofthedannys
Notion,2020-09-30 12:25:54,The maybe bullet journal app,4,"Daunting and confusing to use at first opening; bit of a steep learning curve. Once I got used to working with “blocks” and figured out the app’s system of organizing data works, I was able to start playing with the app successfully. Creating personal templates was the hardest part, but once I got them to work, the app is a suitable and potentially excellent way to keep and maintain a bullet journal. Lots of potential for being a personal database, bujo, recipe book, handy reference tool. I like the desktop app very much and how it syncs quickly with iOS apps. 

I wish they had more export page sizes like A5, Executive, and half-size to print pages and place them in smaller binders. Also, better printing capabilities from both iOS and MacOS apps for those of us still in-love with analog journals and notebooks. And, guys, seriously, the premium PDF subpage document export feature is essential. Please rethink making this available to all or as an add-on to a personal account. Seriously. Wow.",Kiri Pawo
Notion,2022-09-22 04:45:45,Truly game-changing,5,"I use this app every day, countless times a day. I regularly wonder what would happen to my brain if the internet was out for a prolonged period and I couldn’t access Notion. I started out using basic pages for note-taking, but it quickly became clear that I could create templates for my weekly work tasks and personal projects in almost no time at all, customized to how I work. Now all my crap lives in this app, and it honestly gives me so much peace of mind knowing if I need to remember to do something or want to look something up, I just have to jot it down in Notion or do a search, and I can find it without a second thought. I will say, though, after years of using this app, the thing that prompted me to write this looong thing is that Notion inexplicably changed the color of their checkboxes. To a normal person this wouldn’t be a big deal, but their original sky blue is one of my favorite colors and I have come to associate it with the calm you feel when crossing things off your list. Now, the new checkbox blue is more harsh, and the vibe is *decidedly* different. Take it from an over-user — y’all should change it back, please!",indumania
Notion,2022-03-18 11:39:56,My girlfriend is jealous of Notion,5,"This app has taken over my life as I spend a big part of my day working in Notion. I can organize my entire life in my space and keep notes from classes and life, I can keep a detailed reading list, I keep ideas and random thoughts organized in here, there’s almost a limitless amount of things you can do with Notion. 

Yes, there’s a steep learning curve but I found that it was worth it to get my life in order. DI looked on here to give a review and I saw a 4.1 rating!!!! What is that? This deserves a much better rating, but oh well. I guess it’s not for everyone since it is a big commitment on time, but if you are willing to put the work in, you’ll have much more than a calendar and todo list. You’ll have an operating system for your life! There’s so many resources as well that will show you the ropes and get you up to speed. Marie Poulin and August Bradley were where I turned, but there are so many other good ones out there but it’s all about your style and what you want to accomplish in it. 

I’m going to stop this here because I could write here all day, but I need to get back to my workspace.",Hextered
Notion,2022-09-28 21:35:02,Notion changed my life,5,"I’ve never written a review for an app, I simply never felt a need to. Notion on the other hand since I started using it I’ve been telling everyone I know about it. This is THE perfect app for me it’s everything I would’ve thought of putting in a note taking, self organization, even a collaborative piece of software. It’s basically the Swiss army knife of note taking apps. It helped me recalibrate my life when I was feeling overwhelmed by the mass amount of information I was receiving and there’s just something about the cover images of the Met that they use that just relaxes me. It feels as if this app was created specifically for me. One last thing is the fact that it’s cross platform meaning when I get home and go on my windows PC I can see all the notes I’ve been taking on the go from my MacBook or if I have a list I want to check out really quickly while walking I can seamlessly use my IPhone to look at the Notion app.  Thank you for creating such an amazing piece of software, I will be using this for a long long time",Gelo's Reviews
Notion,2023-03-22 09:26:54,"Fantastic, but mobile needs changes.",5,"Notion is an absolutely fantastic app for projects, notes, sorting, and many many more due to its versatility and freedom. As a single person, notion is completely free with next to no restrictions. Teams will require payment, but it has a free trial to see how you like it, and I consider it fantastic for groups. 

However, that being said, mobile notion is severely lacking in certain features that the desktop version has. Basic features like renaming your workspace can only be done on desktop. There are also some bugs with the ui, like the back arrow sometimes just straight up sending me out of the current workspace, and the toolbar disappearing and requiring me to restart the app.

These don’t ruin the app by any means, as notion is still an amazing app and is still amazing in mobile, but I would consider mobile notion a great ADDITION to your desktop notion. Use desktop as your main form of using notion when creating, and use mobile when you’re away from the desktop or need to check something. Mobile as your only form of using notion isn’t terrible, but it’s definitely inferior.

Notion overall is an amazing app with amazing developers, who deserve lots of love and support. They also gave major generosity with the app, of which many other services would’ve charged the individual a large amount of money to use what notion gives for free, which again is pretty much everything except very minor things like upload file size limits.",The Cone Hater
Notion,2021-03-04 05:37:17,Never been more organized,5,"Absolutely life changing. I have never been more organized. It feels like I’m decluttering my life—every single thing has it’s place and when I have to schedule something new, I can pull out my calendar and immediately know what days and times are best for me. I have separate pages for school and personal, and each is broken down further (ex. School is broken down by degree, then course, then week, then assignment & I have an “Assignment Calendar” and a “Readings and Lectures Calendar”).
I watched several videos on how to use Notion, and to be honest, I prefer the desktop version (I really only got the app so I could have it on my phone). The videos I watched were specific to the topics I wanted (that is, school & personal) so it was easier for me to get a hold on the things I wanted/needed from Notion. Plenty of people make suuuuper specific templates, so if you don’t want to make everything yourself, you can just download a template and edit it. It isn’t as hard as it seems!!!",janedoe-
Notion,2020-08-18 23:07:52,"Good app, unreliable performance",3,"I really enjoy the features of this application. However, I have run into a problem multiple times now where the app will refuse to open. I click on it and the loading screen pops up but then nothing happens no matter how long I wait. I’ve tried clearing my apps, restarting my device, updating the app if there are updates, but none of it helps the issue go away. The only way I have been able to resolve this issue when it occurs is by deleting and redownloading, which is far from convenient. I have noticed that multiple times when this issue occurred I was also playing a podcast from my device at the same time, but I can’t be sure if that has anything to do with it. If it does, clearing the podcast app and stoping the podcast does not help fix the issue anyway.

An additional issue that impacts my flow through the app is an inability to copy and paste multiple lines/blocks of text. This is possible from the desktop version but not on iPad. 

I’d give 5 stars if it weren’t for these pernicious issues.",ThumderDrummer
Notion,2020-11-22 18:26:20,Best. Hands down.,5,"I can still hardly believe Notion is free to use (for personal use at least, I haven’t tried to collaborative/business mode).

There’s SO MUCH you can accomplish with this app: note-taking, to-dos, lists, wiki’s, databases, journaling, etc.

I’ve used a handful of other apps with varying levels of success and satisfaction: Bear, Noto, Evernote, OneNote, Dropbox Paper, and of course the default Notes app. Each have their own limitations, quirks, and restrictions. Most require a subscription fee. Myself, it’s difficult to justify paying a subscription for an app that I will, in theory, use for the rest of my life (or until a new app or technology renders it unnecessary). (ie: $4.99/month sounds reasonable until I think—I might live another 40-50 years—which means $4.99 x 12 x 50 = ~$3,000!)

To wrap this up: Notion does it all. You can use the features you need to cater to your purpose without the features you don’t getting in your way. I honestly haven’t come across a page I haven’t been able to setup and create based on what I pictured in my mind. So versatile it’s crazy! Oh and did I mention it’s FREE?!

I’m guessing Notion will be bought by a Microsoft, Evernote, or other competitor in the near future. But I’m hoping the powers that be will protect this app and let it continue in its current form forever.

Thanks so much for making an app that is sincerely a game-changer to so many people’s daily workflows.",trentmorris
Notion,2021-01-04 16:46:28,Couldn’t be angrier,1,"Work that was very meaningful to me and represented a lot of time has been deleted from my Workspace, I believe because I let my Pro account expire and was over the block limit. I am appalled that work was just removed from my workspace without so much as a warning. I could have and would have deleted basically anything else in the workspace and been okay, but the one single thing that I was important to me is the thing that was removed. 

Thankfully, my phone for whatever reason hasn't synced with the web version (which under normal circumstances would be horrible, but in this circumstance has saved me a ton of trouble). I can't do anything except hand-type the data into a new spreadsheet since I can't mass copy cells on my phone, which if infuriating, but at least my data is saved. It is going to take literal hours to hand type, however. 

Notion's decision to destroy my data without notification has definitely lost me as a customer, and I will not be recommending to anyone else.  I was so gung-ho about this product at first, too, but destruction of data is absolutely over the line.",deffinbro
Notion,2022-06-09 18:13:15,"Great application, Terrible mobile app",4,"I’ve been using Notion for a few months now and finally got a system down that works for me. This program is seriously so great for personalizing your digital workspace. I’m using it for so many things and I love it rn. 
That said, the mobile app is pretty sub-par. So many basic functions are completely unavailable or disfunctional. It’s very frustrating trying to organize/restructure/redesign anything through mobile and it’s also kinda buggy which is such a shame because it has so much potential.

A few pros and cons
PROS:
- Super Versatile
- Customizable
- Database handling
- Free to use most essential features

CONS:
- Mobile App functions poorly
- Steep learning curve
- Customer Service kinda stinks (I get the feeling they probably prioritize paying/business customers over everyone else, which tbh is fair but still a bit frustrating)
- accessibility features pretty negligent

SUGGESTIONS:
- make mobile more functional
- more color choices; honestly, more ways to customize page/feature appearances in general would be nice

All said and done, thank you for the hard work y’all have put in to make this super powerful program free to use. That in and of itself is pretty amazing. While there’s always room for improvement, I have been enjoying my experience for the most part and look forward to the future!",apmanda

Some thing about this app just reminds me to keep coming back and to add stuff to it and to actually look at it when I need to.I won’t go on forever about this app you should just download it and try it for yourself since it’s free. There is a paid version which I will be using to organize my Instagram videos and pictures, which is amazing. I use it for so many things and it’s amazing. I love the way it’s set up to organize things into different categories and the ability to add pages and links and things like that. It has everything you could need. I love it!",Destiny Nugent
Notion,2021-08-07 22:45:25,Good app for reviewing,2,"I am a huge fan of Notion. I use it several hours everyday to tackle, organize, and create things for both my work and home life. It is a truly amazing tool that has replaced several apps that I used to rely on. Don’t let this iOS app discourage, go check out the platform. 

That said, the iPhone app is fairly useless when it comes to creating and organizing content. It’s slow, clunky, and buggy. It’s a fine enough app if you’re simply using it to review your content inside Notion. It’s slightly better on iPad, but still not great. This is very clearly a desktop app that’s not reached maturity on mobile. Working with text, tables, styles, is slow and unintuitive (or broken). Trying to select text, hold space to move your cursor, make edits across multiple paragraphs is all basic functionality required to be efficient in Notion, and none of it works right in the current app.

So if you’re new to Notion or wanting to test it out, use a computer. This app will not give you a full sense of what this amazing app is capable of.",tanookisuit_ty
Notion,2020-08-22 22:49:01,This app is game-changer. They mean it when they “all-in-one” workspace,5,"Please please please don’t ever get rid of this app—I’ve built too much! I cannot put into words how much I love this app. It’s so incredibly versatile meaning you can use it for organizing your files, taking notes, writing assignments, to-do list, reminders, etc. you name it.  Basically, it’s google drive, Evernote, calendar, journal and Todoist, but centralized in one place. You can access it on all platforms (MacOS, iPhone, ipad), but I just prefer to use the web version on my devices since it can be kinda difficult to move blocks around or adjust its size on the iOS version. 

Notion would completely replace all my productivity apps if they would just incorporate a handwriting feature and maybe more typography options. 

Overall, I love this app and can’t believe how I was able to live without it for so long. As a ADHD graduate student, this app saved my life.",442nd
Notion,2023-02-25 21:49:03,Amazing Support Team,5,"I am new to using Notion as I am back in school. I have been talking pages and pages of notes, but when I switched between pages, it brought me to the top of the page, rather than where I was originally on the page. I messaged support to see if there was a setting or for notion to remember my scroll location when jumping between pages. Unfortunately, there isn’t. But I am writing this review and still giving 5 stars for the Support Team.  They quickly got back to me and asked me to explain in further detail what I meant. When they told me there was not a setting for Notion to remember my scroll location, Vlasis (the support team member emailing me back) said he would pass on this on to the engineering team as it would be a helpful tool to have.

Notion,2023-01-10 19:48:59,The UI is very difficult to figure out…,3,"This is great app, but it is very difficult to edit and make pages. It’s confusing to make subpages, and it take me 20+ minutes to edit a “page.” And that’s just for headings, subheadings and lists, nothing decorative. When making a new list I had to click on the in page table of contents to make it, and it messed up the ordering of the headings I wanted to make. I love the creativity of this app, but the limiting UI and confusing layout is so hard to make me want to us it everyday. I only use this a few times a week to update my pages because it is that difficult to use. I also find it weird how I said I was using this for myself but it loves to prompt me to add my more people to my project. No. If I said this was personal why have any options for me to add people?!

Notion,2022-08-01 07:31:58,New Update is Backwards and Bad.,3,"This app is great and I use it regularly but trying to use it with the new update is more annoying than whatever you were trying to achieve with it. I can't drag and drop pages on the main tab anymore, the keyboard now covers up the screen instead of allowing you to see the text fully, and the feature where it starts on the main tab instead of on the last page you were on or a selected page is extremely annoying and unnecessary.

Everytime I get this update, I just delete the app and redownload it so I can get the previous version of the app instead. Please either fix these issues, give a set of toggle-on options in settings to enable these settings, or get rid of the update all together. I love this app and use it for nearly everything that involves writing down notes but this update is just awful and makes it harder to use the app.",http.lemon🍋
Notion,2021-08-05 15:41:06,Major accessibility issue,3,"Still no option to increase text size and both light and dark modes use grey typeface which means there’a very little contrast making it extremely unfriendly to vision impaired users. Can a developer respond to this and let me know if this is on the roadmap? Text size understandably is more intensive to implement but making the dark mode a true black background with true white text and vice versa the opposite for light mode could be achieved in minutes. Thank you in advance for considering accessibility 😃

I really want to permanently move to this from Evernote that I’ve paid for many years BUT the dark mode is a deal breaker at the moment. It’s more like “grayscale mode” which makes things very difficult to read sometimes because of a lack of contrast. I’m really surprised any designer would do that. PLEASE just give us true black or something much closer to black. (Same issue on MacOS app) 🖤🖤🖤",NYCNYCNYCNYC
Notion,2022-04-12 19:58:21,Great but could be better,4,"Notion is one of the note talking apps I’ve ever used, especially as a college student. I absolutely love the features that it offers, and the simplicity of the interface makes it so easy to use. It’s really easily to take notes during zoom meetings too, and the toggle feature is one of my favorites. The one thing I wish though is that each specific page stayed on the section you were at, instead of resetting at the top of the page when you enter it again. (This means that if I leave a page that I was working on and taking notes on, when I enter it again I have to scroll all the way down again which is really annoying). Secondly, it’s a little laggy especially on PC and it takes a few seconds for the words I’ve typed to appear on the page. Other than that, great app!",juicesqe
Notion,2021-01-26 06:56:52,"Amazing app, potential to be the best.",5,"I’ve tried many apps to find a place where I can create a to-do list, create a master list of my assignments, have a schedule of classes and assignments on a calendar, while keeping everything categorized and separate. Although a lot of apps do some of this things better, none of them so far have done all of these things. Enter notion.

This app has been by far the best combination of everything I’ve been looking for. The setting up process is not as user friendly as most, but the end product is great after learning the setup. There are many interface changes i’d like to see in order to make the app more user-friendly, therefore am looking forward to the updates.

Private Pages and Workspace Pages can be favorited, but not shared pages.  This is a really strange aspect about Shared and one of a few spots where it feels like the shared pages end up being a bit of a step child (though a very powerful tool!)

At our company we’ve also accidentally lost some top-level pages of our workspace from time to time (mostly because people accidentally delete them or move the into a private page etc…). Each time it’s happened, the version history has not been effective in searching and restoring our top-level pages (even for admins).

I appreciate that you can still edit pages and formulas exactly as you would on desktop! As a mobile app it can be slightly unwieldy, and not always optimized for your screen or super aesthetic. Notion has a semi-steep learning curve and if it's your first time using it, I'd recommend setting everything up/formatting your pages on desktop first and getting the hang of it that way. After you do that it's a pretty smooth ride! Love this app, it's helped me organize my entire life – some things I didn't even know needed organising until I found Notion!

I forget which account I have all my organized notes in, so I keep having to delete the app entirely and redownloading it again.

Notion,2021-05-02 21:29:54,Horrible first impression,2,"I signed up for notion to possibly replace my 10 year Evernote subscription (The optimize to google articles made a compelling case for Notion). I downloaded the app and immediately was asked to choose between a personal account or business account. Since I use my Evernote for both personal and business I decided to choose a business account. Immediately I was handed a multiple choice form listing specific parts of a business that I needed to choose from in order to continue. Wow. I just wanna place to put all of my contacts in one searchable location. So I am going everywhere in the app trying to find a way to change my business account to a personal account with no luck. And the chat window I am trying to use for their support tells me it will be hours before I get a response. Not an email response mind you better response I would have to wait inside of a chat window for. At least I have to assume that because there was no clarification. These were three strikes against notion in my first five minutes of using the app. 
I’ve said it before and I will say it again: your initial impression of how dealing with a company outside of simply using their advertised products is usually how it will be dealing with that company in the future outside of simply using their products.

2 stars.

Notion,2023-01-03 08:23:25,"Custom font, size, and better calendars",4,The app is great! It has so much potential to be many different things. I would say they need to refine the basics. You should be able to change fonts of text per line not just whole page. It would also be nice if they included more fonts to pic from besides the 3 available choices. Then the side is an issue. The only way to change text size is to use header menus but it’s limited as they are preset to certain sizes. It would be nice if we could choose 12 or 14 or 26 a numeral value like all other apps. Lastly the calendar data base could use a rework. It seems very basic and doesn’t have essentials like adding repeating events.

The keyboard and GUI do not appear properly making it incredibly hard to type and navigate the app. I really used to love this app but it just seems like the developers do not care anymore and I am honestly thinking of switching to another writing app. The app will randomly log me out and then quickly log me back in like it realized I wasn't supposed to be logged out, a huge security hazard. The app LAGS when I try to type only a few sentences. My pages don't load and so I have to close and reopen the app a bunch until it properly loads in my writing.

Notion,2020-12-30 15:40:41,Y’all. This app is amazing.,5,"I loved this app from the very first day. You can do so many things with it, from to do lists, schedules, databases, bullet-journal-type spreads, and so much more, while using the same technique for everything. It is super simple and easy to use, and has so many features. You can make tables, graphs, charts, and even make a webpage out of a notion workspace.

I tried many organization apps, like Evernote, Dropbox, keep, and the notes app, but this is the most functional.

I use it to organize my entire life, from school, work, and general life improvement. Their templates make the app easier to use, and gave me ideas on how to improve myself and track my progress. It helps me with time management since I have a busy schedule. 

Even in my free time, this app helps me improve with the templates. I don’t think this is the purpose of the templates, but I still love them 😅. They have templates like habit trackers, weekly agendas, club workspaces, reading lists, job applications, and so much more. It makes me feel like reading, building new habits, and helps me make the most out of my time.

This is by far my favorite organization/productivity app because it actually helps me get more productive.",jill472

As an undergrad, it’s taking the brunt of my stress from the oncoming assignments and exams into something more manageable. I absolutely love the little customizations in adding icons and headers, and honestly, the only  thing I could ask for is synchronization with Google calendars? Since a lot of my day to day events are entered through there, it’d be nice to have it somehow linked to everything else on my notion as well. 

My only real complaint would be to just please let us add an option to crop and move around the header positions on the app, but that’s mostly superficial (still tho, @ dev’s please please please add this option, ty in advance) and can be remedied by going onto the physical website on a computer.",catch up to the android ver

It wasn’t until rare situations where I needed to do something I don’t normally do, and export a bunch of notes to provide a friend, copy larger sections of notes, etc, that there are issues. Exporting a “database” as they call it is fine, but it just exports the note and none of the sub-pages that requires a business yearly cost.
Duplicate and Delete right next to each other and you wanna duplicate a “database” (which didn’t work) but miss clicked? Deleted. I was so devastated and their restore options are garage and costumer service won’t help unless paid business account.

The location of “delete” after you press the ellipses changes depending on the type of item you select, yet delete is one of the most commonly used features here.

Some sort of happy medium between a database/list and a dumb checklist on a page would be great! Todoist handles this really well! Also when I swipe from the left side of the screen I expect to open the menu, not go “back”. This behavior is inconsistent and not useful.

This app is for people comfortable with doing things digital, are interested in optimizing their productive life, and are open to trying new things. It is probably not for people who prefers analog ways of organizing life or those who has a (valid) need for offline support. It’s desirable because of its (1) pixel-perfect style and UI, (2) module-based interaction paradigm that is ahead of its time and different from every alternative app (evernote, excel) when it started, and (3) collaborative ability as an essential component from the get-go",Davide D Zhang

Another thing: I hate how my embedded soundcloud song/playlist asks me to play in browser, another thing that weights down on the sleekness of design this whole app is going for. It’s so clunky.

Notion,2020-08-15 16:27:41,"Notion is great, but not on iPad",3,"Been using Notion on my MacBook for years, without much issue. The experience on iPad, however, is extremely lackluster – not to mention limited – compared to the MacBook app. I find that odd, since the MacBook app is Electron based and the iPad app behaves like a WebView wrapper.

Keyboard shortcuts – even the sidebar ones – only work if you are actively inputting text. Many common shortcuts for text editing, like shift+tab and cmd+return either work sporadically or don’t work at all. The helper shortcuts (like holding cmd to view shortcuts) doesn’t work. The trackpad experience is also not great, but since Notion doesn’t use native components, I can’t really expect it to behave like in other apps.

Notion,2020-09-03 12:52:23,The app works Online only not Offline,1,"My experience with this app unlike Evernote which I have been a passionate user for now a decade, yes 10 years. 

Now the greatest fear in Notion app is I will loose all my content on my devices as there could be an ulterior motive of the app developers to not allow the user to use content when they fit right.

What happens is in Notion on my iOS devices iPad and iPhone when I am in the app and want to access some content the app asks for a user name and password.

Which is fine and good for security, but when I have no internet connectivity my password cannot be sent and verified by Notion. So I cannot use Notion and so can’t use the contents when needed.

So this app is an online app, it would not work if it is offline. As it is just like a web page in a app form.

Now my whole purpose of an app unlike Evernote is defeated if I want to access content any time any where without internet access. For Evernote for example  I always save all my travel notes and maps so that when no internet connectivity is there I can use the notes, refer, edit add on the go.

The greatest plus of Notion, I like is the format and design of the app the key being a database of my contents which can be easily accessible, searched, sorted and filtered.

When using a keyboard, for some reason the app flips out and does not know whether it’s using touch or keyboard input. I can’t tap or type anything, as it keep flipping the bottom nav bar back and forth. I have to constantly have to unplug my keyboard to even tap into and be able to type anything…. Not really useful to be typing with a iOS’s default keyboard on a large iPad Pro when I have a perfectly usable keyboard hooked up. And essentially renders this app useless.

After the first block on a page, it is often difficult to tap to move the text cursor and double tap features that allow for cut/paste are unavailable after the first block. This is difficult for copy pasting notes from a Chrome window or editing text earlier in the block without deleting a few sentences.

I love being able to customize individual page’s notes organization, and honestly that’s the killer feature of this app. The individual pages, things like spreadsheets and boards, can be a bit wonky at times, but for these it’s more of a quantity over quality thing. My only gripe is that the mobile versions (iOS and iPadOS) of this app are missing a bit of the functionality of this app’s desktop brethren, which doesn’t make sense since its web app so I don’t know why its missing some of it but overall this app is really good.",Milk-Dude
Notion,2021-02-01 04:29:25,S-L-O-W,1,"I love Notion's features! It is a true game changer. It is also supposed to be a productivity app, and it fails miserably, at that. I'm using a 2018 iPad Pro, 2018 Macbook Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max. On each of these devices, the typing lag is unbearable. For instance, I type a 10-15 word sentence, and then sit back for 10-20 seconds and wait for my text to appear on screen. Or, I try to scroll the sidebar, only for it to seemingly say to me, ""Huh? I don't understand what you want from me?"" So, I try scrolling again. It eventually works, but I have wasted more time waiting on this app than is acceptable, especially something made for being productive. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, shut down, rebooted, and even rebuilt my iPad and iPhone as new. No improvement. I do not experience this lag on videos, other apps, or on the internet, in general. I'm a paying customer, as I'm not using the free, individual plan, and I feel like I've been had.",Cepcer
Notion,2022-07-22 05:04:41,Update is no bueno,4,"I wrote a five star review, but imma have to take it down a star, just because this latest update is full of QOL downgrades on iOS. You can no longer drag and drop, which was a big thing I enjoyed, and on what you can drag and drop, sometimes you scroll the whole page along with the item, making it useless. Just a whole lotta weird downgrades like that. Sidebar is funky now, too, and hides all but two of the pages I have on it, and whereas the sidebar before was a simple swipe away, now it seems to have a whole other page for it that makes you click in and out. 
I very much prefer the UI from before the last update.",Giggles the Cranky Gyarados
Notion,2020-10-17 18:52:30,IOS version is lacking one important thing...,4,"I love this app ... on a computer ... the IOS version is great, except, it’s really, really difficult to get text out of the app and put it into another app ... cut and paste are basic functions but they don’t work on more than one “block” of text. The export function is weak, giving you a link  to share ... when I need to get text out of this app, I get a link to a PDF ... open that PDF in a browser and then copy the text. Add to this frustration the fact that some characters don’t copy over (e.g. auto numbers)...

It’s a great app ... I give it 4 stars with confidence because it seems like moving text out of the app is an intentional decision by the developers ... but, I’m not a fan.",matt mcgill

My jaw drops when using this app, no joke. I feel like I can do anything and everything with Notion and it has every little thing that you could possibly want to make your work more comfortable. I love how I can make my life so much more organized but also how I can make it cute. Not having to carry around multiple apps or journals for my calendar, schedule, studying, etc. and instead having it all in one place is awesome. Notion is literally my favorite app by far.",corilace
Notion,2022-03-25 18:25:30,A lot of issues on the app lately,1,"I love Notion and I installed the app a few months ago because even though I also use it on PC, I prefer taking notes from my phone. It used to work perfectly fine, had no problems other than a few occasional glitches easily solved by restarting the app.
But lately (I believe ever since the “block” feature was removed) the app hasn’t been working well for me. Here are the issues I’m encountering:
- Whenever I press enter to write a new line on a page, the blinking text cursor disappears on that page forever and it’s impossible to know where I am typing anymore. I tried closing the keyboard, tapping on a different spot on the page, and restarting the app but the text cursor does not reappear.
- Text selection is impossible, there is no way to highlight text properly anymore. (might have to do with the text cursor being gone)
- The bold/italic options no longer appear, so I can no longer edit text on mobile.
- I can no longer add images to my notes. That feature was part of the bold/italic options and since that is gone, there is no way for me to insert photos.

I really hope these issues get fixed soon, because they currently make the app unusable for me.",Najouaaa
Notion,2022-05-10 17:02:44,Great Idea Awful Execution,1,I’ve switched to another app because A) they blocked a bunch of users and gave them no access to their data with no warning or help.  This was in response to economic sanctions against the country the users were from so that’s understandable but doesn’t lead me to trust that they respect or care about their users at all.  Also B) app takes waaaaayyy too long to load.  I have not input even half the content I want to and it’s noticeably slow and laggy.  This is further exacerbated by databases (which they expect you to use instead of tables… instead of just letting you… link pages… inside of… tables… really?) which slow things down even more.  They at no point with any real enforceability promise not to sell your data and… they still charge you for premium subscriptions.  At least Gmail is free.,mckenzielja
Notion,2023-03-31 06:29:45,Almost perfect,4,"There are so many great features about Notion, but also quite a few missed ones.
I love all the different database styles and how easy it is to change from one to another or link them to another page, but on the iPad it’s incredibly frustrating to see so much wasted screen real estate. There’s absolutely no way to change the column sizes on any database view on mobile devices. When I have a column that’s just a checkbox, that’s bad. Half my screen is empty space instead of the data I need to see.

Great app in terms of logging data, but this seems like a key feature that should not have slipped through the cracks…",IamFluffy90
Notion,2022-10-21 09:58:21,5 stars. But also 4 stars.,4,"The concept and product itself deserve 5 stars hands down. But the product on the App Store? 4 stars. The only thing I dislike about the App Store version is that it is not very iOS friendly. It looks really nice and I can do basic things on my iOS devices, but without my phone or iPad, I cannot do specific things to my pages, such as resizing images, which is just frustrating enough to deduct a star. I really enjoy using this for productivity, but it isn’t reasonable for me to have to carry my phone, iPad, AND my laptop with me when I want to use Notion.
Please make the app more iOS friendly! It is amazing otherwise!!",PunchedHercules

It’s become the go-to software my roommate and I. I moved my google sheets over and I use it to track my savings, write notes, and for anything I can! It’s so clean. Thank you for making this product, and for making a free version. It is so helpful for those of us who may not be able to take on another subscription in this economy. That being said, unlike other productivity software, this is absolutely worth every recurring charge. Thank you for making this software!!",tallyschwenk
Notion,2022-01-12 03:10:46,"Psst, Devs—feeling pretty limited because I can’t scroll 😉",4,"Primary reason to love the app: limitless ways to organize any sort of information. Basically helps me put all the mess in my brain on “paper” (i.e. a personal wiki, but better and with templates). Frustrating: can’t scroll the tag zone when adding tags to a table. Tagging is so, so important for filtering through databases. I was just capped at 37 tags for an item because I ran out of screen real estate. Low-hanging fruit but please fix this. 🙏 Whoever read ‘til the end— Notion team has done a great job.

I love that you can make tables, lists, boards, and blogs. You can import documents and images as well. The only thing I think would request is getting to customize the background color of the side panel. It just for personal style. It's so good that that's all I'd request lol.",Christie56557

However I’m desperate for an offline mode that I switched back to Apple notes. Notion has all features I want but sorry I have to give it up. Accessing my notes offline is critical that nothing else can compromise. I understand the data structure of notion limits the possibility to run offline but even a cache mechanism would help me. I can download my data before I knew I’ll be offline, for example before a flight. Hope you can offer such simple alternatives and that will be the time I come back to notion app. I’m ready to pay for that feature.",chendfus
Notion,2021-02-01 15:44:09,Overall a good solution on mobile,4,"Generally the product works very well between desktop and mobile. Many of the key features that I use on desktop are also available and easy to use on mobile. 

Certain aspects of the app can be a little frustrating. Search never remembers your preferences if you want to only match titles. Every time I search (which I do a lot) I have to enter that preference again. 

Navigation back and forth between pages Is not easy. There's no swipe gestures as far as I'm aware that a game like the back arrow on desktop.  This then forces me to use bread dumb navigation which can be hard to use on mobile. Feels like a lot of clicks to get where I want.",JadedEvan

It is a great organizational app. However, i have noticed that for some reason, I have trouble getting it to work properly when I’m using my Apple Pencil. Whenever I attempt a toggle to insert text and start writing, the text completely disappears. I am unable to make selections and more when using my Apple Pencil. I have even been unable to open the text box because the Apple Pencil toolbox will just fade away very quickly before I can select that option. I have force closes the app, restarted my iPad, disconnected and changed the top for my Apple Pencil. But it still does this ever so often. This doesn’t happen in any other app.",semajae monique

I’d select one sentence and it’d go from that point to the very bottom of the text. It also moves the screen up while selecting, which can also make it select from the selection point up. 
I’m pretty sure this problem only applies to mobile because it hasn’t happened to me writing on my computer, but it’s pretty annoying.

other than that notion has really helped me keep track of my writing, it allows me to be organized and it’s very helpful",luner 3clyps

I created an account, played around with the app a bit, and started to write up some notes. I was amazed by the vast yet simple app. I like minimalistic apps, and this one was absolutely solid.

Notion has really kept me productive lately. I can group notes together, link pages to other pages, collaborate in workspaces, etc. It’s just full of stuff, yet it’s easy to use.

If you are struggling with keeping on track, I highly suggest you download this app. It’ll change your life.

Only problems I’m having is the fact that you can’t delete workspaces on mobile. Even opening a webpage on mobile won’t work. You can only do it on PC, so those of you without PC’s, be aware.

Devs, please make it more mobile-friendly.

I heavily use my iPad and Mac together throughout the day, and the one thing I’ve been needing for a year now, is the ability to do sketching, draw diagrams, and take handwritten notes via the Apple Pencil. If I want to share a diagram I’ve drawn out, I have to use another app, screenshot and then import into Notion, which seems quite unnecessary… It would be amazing if I could create pages specifically for Apple Pencil notes, with an infinite canvas.",julianstogs

Just one bug that really annoys is im not able to zoom out on my phone to take good look at chats. Would be amazing for a future update ability to zoom out charts to have a better look on the phone.

Notion,2021-02-04 16:35:09,iOS notes and reminders work better,2,"I haven’t even been using this for a day. It had a lot options among the templates ( kinda really hard to find the right one needed ). It was hard to set up my template. Same way you could not add or delete images, tables etc. stuffs as easy as I do it in the iOS notes app.
I expect an app that helps me do journaling, note taking, revision, rough notes etc. stuffs, notion provides them but I do them way better in iOS notes. The best thing thing I found here was that it had toggle list which made bullet points and extra information hide under the main info, it helps your note look minimal in space. I first downloaded it thinking that my notes would be available on an iPhone or Mac as well. But with the m1 chip Macs I don’t I need it everything is available there too, than why needed ?????
Thus, 
iOS notes & reminders could do better for easy note taking and journaling.
Notion for the same function but with more options...

Anyway perspective changes from person to person, so try once and find your best. 

Hope this would be helpful for finding the right app for you...

Notion,2021-06-07 23:35:07,"Fantastic, but needs more mobile-centric design",5,"Let me just start off by saying that I basically run my business with Notion. I love it, it keeps me nice and organized, and there’s so many customization options. 

That being said, the mobile experience needs some work. It feels too ported over from desktop, but also fails to remember my desktop preferences when it comes to board layouts (it’ll un-hide and re-order columns that I have hidden and ordered on desktop).

My biggest gripe is with the mobile calendar view. It’s shrunk down so much that it takes a few taps to see the event on that day, read it, and then get back the calendar view. If they made it full view, with previews of the event/task like on desktop, I’d love it. Apple’s native Calendar app comes to mind as an example in terms of the week and month view. 

Overall, I love Notion as a desktop app, but mobile feels like an afterthought and needs some design tweaks.",kelseyrodriguez
Notion,2021-11-03 16:11:11,Amazing! Needs more desktop features,5,"Notion has taken over my life. I’ve converted my personal life into wiki dashboards and have evangelized this tool to dozens of others. The iPad app lags behind the desktop all though. Basic things like adjusting the zoom scaling to fit more content on the screen is one example. It feels ironic that my iPad and laptop are both M1 units but the laptop version is so much more advanced.

I highly recommend Notion, but don’t expect to get the same performance from the iPad app as you will on a laptop or web browser.",Eternity Bob

I’m a heavy an i use MacBook user of iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS and they’ve helped us achieve a new level in organization and interactions with these devices. Great work. But because it’s an amazing app I want more of it. The app needs to enable image cropping. Taking notes with graphs and such on Notion would be even better if I can focus certain image and crop out the rest, quick and simple. Having to leave the app and trying to do it stops the workflow. More importantly, Notion needs to fully work with Apple Pencil. Handwritten notes should happen. Please make it possible. Thanks.",Tugxd

I do wish that the widget showed the contents of a page rather than just the title of the page being a shortcut to the app. That way I could easily see one of the lists/calendars/other databases created on Notion on my homescreen. Otherwise, everything is great! Very happy with Notion!",day6 fan ig

 But for the person who has a busy professional life and/or very active social life, managing all of that information can be down so easily in Notion. And your Notion home page can be designed to look almost any way you can imagine.

It’s taken me years to find somewhere to journal on a consistent basis without getting bored or unmotivated from it but with this app the possibilities are endless. A complete extension of who I am and my life. So perfect",nhvhfcn
Notion,2022-07-07 03:31:07,Love this app!,5,"I’ve had this app for a little while now and it’s amazing! As a person with ADHD, jotting things down and making lists has always helped me manage what I need to do and what’s on my mind, and this app is perfect for that! It’s so easy to declutter my mind by simply creating a new notion dedicated to whatever I’m thinking about and organize my thoughts. I love the personalized features that don’t come on other notes apps, such as the page emoji and cover. It all helps me to put what I’m thinking into one page.",person with a pet peeve
Notion,2022-01-16 15:50:47,Like it! Please make it fast and perfect!,5,"Hey! Love your app guys! It is brilliant!!! But sometime I don’t have more features to work with it. Last time I wrote you about Google/Apple map integration and here it is. Thanks. More useful things what can help for many of us:

1) Address property in your database. Everybody uses addresses. Now if I’ll use string as address it never pushes me on to map app.

2) Own draft-templates. Let’s say I have routine with people cards. I have to use someone’s page as references and delete what inside of each property. No good. Then I’ll need template for bugs, then for order… 

3) Reading option. It would be perfect if I’ll have “view-only option” even for myself: now on phone or ipad if I’ll touch screen keyboard will pops, but I’m just trying to surf and read what I have, don’t want to edit anything. Button for that probably will help.

Thank you!",Chokmor
Notion,2022-07-21 18:06:43,great app but i wish...,5,I love this app! At first I was confused and didn't know how to use it but with the help of some aesthetic videos i figured it out! Before i found Notion i used this app called MinimaList. It was amazing but VERY simple/minimal but the best feature on there was the lock screen to-do list. It would be on your lock screen and you could check it off there instead of having to open the app. I wish Notion would have this feature because it would increase productivity.,Patty Terps
Notion,2022-03-17 05:16:46,would be great but there’s a major problem,1,"I actually really love Notion! it’s super helpful for planning stories and also just for taking notes. I had been using the computer version, and I downloaded it on my iPad tonight, but there’s one thing that makes the Notion app pretty much only good for viewing notes you’ve taken or making totally new ones. There’s no line to indicate where you are typing! Like, the blinking bar that shows up to let you know where you’re typing? Notion don’t got that! Additionally, since it doesn’t exist, you can’t change where you’re typing. This seems like a small thing but it’s really preventing me from using this app at all. Idk there’s just some setting I’m missing but whatever",Dollar Store Mettaton
Notion,2021-07-17 13:11:53,"Feature-Full, but lacks usability",2,"For reference, I use the Mac app in combination with the iOS app.

Notion seems like a really great note taking app for the right people. There’s a TON of features for creating and organizing notes exactly the way you want. However, I really think it’s too complicated for the average person to use. The simple act of copying or deleting a complex table took me several minutes to figure out. So I think if you take the time to learn and really become proficient at using Notion specifically, it will probably work really well for you. For those who want an easier experience and want to focus on the actual note taking part, I would look elsewhere.",CupidBot
Notion,2022-03-01 04:42:55,Great  app,4,The app is really good at being able to help former ideas help pages block outs anything that you really need to be creative both for a business and as a Individual. If I were to make one suggestion at least fo iOS users would be the add 3-D touch options for the app. The widgets nice and all but 3-D touch would be great to get to favorites a little more quickly. At least the way I organize things on my phone. And if anything is true there’s no original ideas so I’m pretty sure other people would love this as well,sethcane

I’ve spent the past thirty minutes trying to do the most basic things like add a page, change a status, and change a title, all of which work fine on the computer, but it’s useless to try to do them on the iPad.

Notion considerably fosters organisation among all of your notes, documents, etc. Using it encourages me to pay better attention to content and take notes more often.

I could easily use this tool to manage everything in my life, except I cannot. Notion does not use end-to-end encryption and forces user data to be hosted on Notion servers, which means there’s no offline access either. Anything you put into Notion can be seen by anybody who works at Notion (or anyone who gains access to Notion’s servers). When raising this concern with support, I received a recitation about company policy and third-party audits, which, frankly, is not good enough.

But I also use it for my personal stuff like a reading log, food, water, and habit tracker, and also a calendar to put important dates.

The only issue is I can’t expand certain things like I can on the computer or iPad [for example if I have one page in another I can’t expand it to work on it on my phone] I used to be able to but I haven’t been able to.

My only complaint is that we can’t make reoccurring events in the calendar. I’ve read that there are a few workarounds for this but they’re a little too complicated for me.

I use it for budget planning, school, grocery lists, reading lists, and more. I found out that there was an app about a month ago and was very excited to download it to take Notion on the go. However, the app is so clunky and rough that it just doesn’t work for me. I’ll type in tables just for what I’m writing to disappear. I’ll try to type or just scroll and end up moving rows and columns for some reason. The app on my Chromebook is even worse as it will just crash instead of letting me edit. I really love Notion and want this app to improve, but as it is right now I can’t use it.",Shaybo27

This is due to several factors, most significant being it’s flexibility. It harnesses the power of Airtable and other spreadsheet platforms with narrative and nesting ability. I love that it bends to all my needs - whether that’s taking notes on  books, creating a curriculum, keeping client files, or making a to-do list. And the designers seem seriously interested in listening to feedback and making adjustments as needed. So, so good. ☺️",lyricist890

Yes it is kinda confusing to use at first, but all of the features and customization options is what makes it so much better than all the other apps. It took me about a month of using it to get used to it and learn all of the features, but it was definitely worth it.

Who has time/ energy to power up a clunky desktop??!! Eg, Notion for iPad does not support changing column widths inside a table. Google Sheets makes it so easy! // Another huge flaw! I need ability to select multiple blocks for copy & paste. (Again, desktop only!) I should not be limited to moving one block at a time. Some times I have dozens of blocks that need to be moved // Need ability for multiple instances of Notion on iPad. This is why u forced us to upgrade to iOS 13, isn't it? // Stop rating the app 5* people! Wake up! ☕",Packer2020
Notion,2021-07-28 02:33:45,Missing basic features,3,"First off, no simple tables? I want a simple table I can edit _in app_. Sometimes I want to organize my thoughts in a non-database table. This isn’t doable. The work arounds require either a laptop (to make columns that will inevitably break on mobile) or playing with the finicky data tool.

Second, copying or selecting anything is difficult. You can only select one paragraph at a time. Which, when you’re trying to erase a shopping list to start afresh, can get annoying. 

Third, no iPhone calendar integration. As someone who came to Notion to replace my beloved and cute but time and space consuming paper journal, this one is a biggie.

I want to love Notion. I bought a dedicated device to use as a Notion journal for church/work. But it still has so far to go to be what I need. And as fun as I’m sure the new features are to someone with more coding chops than me, a simple table would be more to me than anything.",Ixtaek

The biggest feature it’s missing is the showing of keyboard shortcuts when holding down the command key. Most iPad apps have this feature, this app doesn’t. I’m assuming the developers use some kind of cross platform tech stack to build this that doesn’t conform to iPadOS conventions 100%. The app does have it’s own keyboard shortcuts that don’t require the command key, but I had to google them and it’s not easy to discover within the app itself.",Wayland Chin

Ive been TERRIBLE at organization and getting my life together in general. Its been extremely frustrating because I try very hard to no avail. I can honestly say thank you. This app has changed the way i think about organization and keeping my life in order. Almost to the point where i wanted to give up and just let things happen to me. I was THAT frustrated with all the stuff I had to do in my life.

Note to designers: Compare the inefficient UI of Notions to the streamlined/efficient layout of “Workflowy” and “Transno”. Workflowy and Transno are the exceptionally efficient and streamlined but they lack all the “individual “blocks”  layout that makes Notion (desktop) awesome. 

Notion (Desktop efficiency) + Transno (Outlining & Mindmapping) + Workflowy (everything else) = the greatest, minimalist note taking app ever created. Until then, Notion is a B-student at best. If Jesse Pinkman was an app, he’d be called Notion.",PagesSucks

A request for the app -- please allow us to make columns!

I’ve gotten it to allow me to enter more by disconnecting the keyboard and re-connecting, but eventually the same bug comes up anyway. Full delete and clean re-install makes no difference.

- I can’t change block types, only add new ones.
- I can’t move pages from workspace to workspace.
- I can’t move a child page to the same level as its parent page (child page to root).
- Bug: If the *last letter* of a word in a title goes over the right margin of a page, it does not push the entire word to the next line and it overflows off the screen. It’s like the line break is calculated from where the last letter begins, not ends.
- Bug: When I edit the text properties of a page stored in a table, the text cursor appears two spaces before the actual location I’m typing.

A few of the things i want from desktop notion to the app would be the ability to rearrange and make columns, rearrange categories in tables, and ability to make new windows of notion. That’d be just so much more helpful. But for now, I’m going to do all my major editing and formatting on my laptop and stick to the basics like writing and editing on my notion app here.",Miming_
Notion,2021-02-21 15:47:00,The Upgrade Problem,4,"This is one of the best interfaces. I have used a host of others and I’m currently using this as my personal CRM and it has been a lifesaver during my time in graduate school. The multi-view options to see information presented in different layouts (lists, kanban, etc) is literally the best that you will find anywhere.

My single point of frustration is the difficulty in upgrading. Notice that there is no option for “in app purchases” on the iOS store? I can think of a few reasons as to why that is the case.

In a world that is quickly shifting to mobile why restrict payments to a PC?

Business 101: make it as easy as possible for people to pay.

I love this company and want them to acquire as many paid users as possible. Their developers work hard and should see the full fruits of their efforts.

Notion,2022-04-09 17:02:01,Lack of local storage and crash recovery,1,I lost several hours of work due to the app quietly loosing authentication to the backend AWS service.

I wanna upload a pic from my library. The pic’s size is 3mb in the Apple photo library(I can’t upload screenshots here), however it is 8mb big in the notion upload manager. This is very confusing. I tried to upload it to another app, it says the size is 4mb .
I feel this is very bad. We all know that an individual user can only upload single file of 5mb. This is ok. But it is bad and even illegal to make a 3mb pic 8mb big. This is the way notion will be abandoned.

 Similarly, I cannot select all text on a page and select speak, as “select all” only selects one paragraph. 
The two best ways of voice over are missing in a way that almost feels deliberate.

Notion,2023-02-02 15:25:52,Can't update on iOS 14 (Nov '22-Feb '23+),1,"(I will change or remove this negative review once this is fixed)

Since late 2022, the Notion app won't install on iOS 14. That by itself is unfortunately common.

The issue is something about the app causes it to show up in the App Store 'pending updates' view... and it has not disappeared over time.

Impact: The 'Update All' function is now broken, since pressing that button tries to update Notion; since that always fails now on iOS 14, those errors keep happening _over and over_, until I quit the App Store.

Result: not only can't I update Notion, but one has to update ~all~ of the other apps on the device _one at a time_.

Please fix ASAP. It's already been 3+ months for something that is probably a simple '.plist' or App Store metadata change.",Jim Grisham

Started building pages for everything, business, personal stuff. transferred and organized all of my scattered notes into structured databases. 

The application continues to disappoint though. A bit buggy, a bit sloppy and cumbersome in its UI, occasionally slow. and just doesn’t have those intelligent features you come to expect after using Google and Apple products.

1. What is a property and how do you use it?
2. There is this weird glitch where it scrolls by itself, and it won’t let me move the screen. Is this how the app usually works, or is it a bug/glitch?
