Tinder and related dating apps have a serious issue with unprompted banning that needs to be addressed. This is yet another app that abuses its right to shut down your account without warning. I had been banned from Hinge shortly before being banned on here, so I made an extra conscious effort to carefully review and follow every guideline. However, I knew that my time with my account would likely not last much longer, since Hinge’s customer support service previously sent me an email informing me that they could ban my Tinder simply because they had banned my Hinge. Once again, I had followed every guideline with Hinge, yet my appeal was met with disrespectful criticism and a clear ignorance of the content of my account and messages. I will not even bother submitting an appeal with Tinder because at this point it is not worth supporting this company. BUMBLE does not work with either of these companies as far as I know, and I have so far had a much more pleasant experience with that app as a whole. If you’re lucky on Tinder, you may not get banned right away and be able to enjoy your account for a good 10 months before they kick you off in the middle of messaging one of your matches! Tinder and associated apps (such as Hinge and other less popular websites) do not take the time to address serious threats to their platform (I’ve seen countless blank profiles and even couples with both partners not aware or consenting. My reports were instead met with the banning of my own account) and will instead remove its most dedicated users without warning or explanation. If you still choose to download this app, make the best of it while you can, because any unknown action could have you permanently removed!                                                                          </td></tr>\n",

This affects the stack/deck by showing me people I am not interested in instead of potential matches. I get 30 likes a day and it’s clear they are mostly from men because…why else would they show up if I have it set to women. I paid for tinder to test it out and in under two weeks it’s has shown that the company is grubbing for money with their various levels of subscriptions but will not make an effort to improve the app (these have been known issues since it came out). Now you are losing market share and instead of trying to fix your platform you are changing your prices and adding different features. I do not understand the point of this app if it’s just going to show me men who have swiped right but not women - even though it’s set to man seeking woman Switching to a different app after this months subscription ends - to be fair I have matched with a lot of people but there is no reason I should be sifting through guys when it’s set to women. Flattered that gay men like me but not what I’m interested in hence why I selected women Women get a lot of likes therefore it’s less likely I show up in her deck - if only women could swipe right on me, I would have a better chance of matching because they would show up in my deck sooner. Instead I’m stuck swiping - I see a dude and know my deck count has now been reset and it will be 10, 15, 20 swipes before the next person who likes me shows up in my deck which is usually a guy Lots of fake accounts Basically this is used to advertise only fans and instagram accounts and tinder does very little to clear them from their service I accidentally erased a paragraph - so if you’ve made it here you can probably already tell it’s time to consider a different app</td></tr>\n",

Tinder and related dating apps have a serious issue with unprompted banning that needs to be addressed. This is yet another app that abuses its right to shut down your account without warning. I had been banned from Hinge shortly before being banned on here, so I made an extra conscious effort to carefully review and follow every guideline. However, I knew that my time with my account would likely not last much longer, since Hinge’s customer support service previously sent me an email informing me that they could ban my Tinder simply because they had banned my Hinge. Once again, I had followed every guideline with Hinge, yet my appeal was met with disrespectful criticism and a clear ignorance of the content of my account and messages. I will not even bother submitting an appeal with Tinder because at this point it is not worth supporting this company. BUMBLE does not work with either of these companies as far as I know, and I have so far had a much more pleasant experience with that app as a whole. If you’re lucky on Tinder, you may not get banned right away and be able to enjoy your account for a good 10 months before they kick you off in the middle of messaging one of your matches! Tinder and associated apps (such as Hinge and other less popular websites) do not take the time to address serious threats to their platform (I’ve seen countless blank profiles and even couples with both partners not aware or consenting. My reports were instead met with the banning of my own account) and will instead remove its most dedicated users without warning or explanation. If you still choose to download this app, make the best of it while you can, because any unknown action could have you permanently removed!                                                                          \\\\\n",

This affects the stack/deck by showing me people I am not interested in instead of potential matches. I get 30 likes a day and it’s clear they are mostly from men because…why else would they show up if I have it set to women. I paid for tinder to test it out and in under two weeks it’s has shown that the company is grubbing for money with their various levels of subscriptions but will not make an effort to improve the app (these have been known issues since it came out). Now you are losing market share and instead of trying to fix your platform you are changing your prices and adding different features. I do not understand the point of this app if it’s just going to show me men who have swiped right but not women - even though it’s set to man seeking woman Switching to a different app after this months subscription ends - to be fair I have matched with a lot of people but there is no reason I should be sifting through guys when it’s set to women. Flattered that gay men like me but not what I’m interested in hence why I selected women Women get a lot of likes therefore it’s less likely I show up in her deck - if only women could swipe right on me, I would have a better chance of matching because they would show up in my deck sooner. Instead I’m stuck swiping - I see a dude and know my deck count has now been reset and it will be 10, 15, 20 swipes before the next person who likes me shows up in my deck which is usually a guy Lots of fake accounts Basically this is used to advertise only fans and instagram accounts and tinder does very little to clear them from their service I accidentally erased a paragraph - so if you’ve made it here you can probably already tell it’s time to consider a different app\\\\\n",

It almost seems like you only get likes when you pay for the most expensive package. I have spent a lot of money with tinder but don’t have the means to pay for the time being. That being said, I have not seen a like in months. (That excludes bots) \n",

       "| 9824910516 | 2023-04-15 15:14:49 | Senpai In Diego           | 14.6.0 | thank you, tinder ❤️ have you guys found a partner?      | 1 | don’t believe all of these fake reviews about a success. they never happen. i spent two weeks on tinder after not using it for 2+ years. i got matches. none of them ever met me, the men are ugly, or i would get none at all. it’s like it’s programmed into the app to do that. match uses “prs” to write fake success stories about finding successes years ago on these apps on the app store. thank you for banning me tinder because i found my love on FEELD, on all places. thank you tinder ❤️❤️ he is my shaggy king. tinder, your ripoff kink app is doing better than you. UPDATE: for the love of god, PLEASE stop with the predatory advertising all over NYC train stations/trains.

Charging for this app is not honest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n",

Tinder and related dating apps have a serious issue with unprompted banning that needs to be addressed. This is yet another app that abuses its right to shut down your account without warning. I had been banned from Hinge shortly before being banned on here, so I made an extra conscious effort to carefully review and follow every guideline. However, I knew that my time with my account would likely not last much longer, since Hinge’s customer support service previously sent me an email informing me that they could ban my Tinder simply because they had banned my Hinge. Once again, I had followed every guideline with Hinge, yet my appeal was met with disrespectful criticism and a clear ignorance of the content of my account and messages. I will not even bother submitting an appeal with Tinder because at this point it is not worth supporting this company. BUMBLE does not work with either of these companies as far as I know, and I have so far had a much more pleasant experience with that app as a whole. If you’re lucky on Tinder, you may not get banned right away and be able to enjoy your account for a good 10 months before they kick you off in the middle of messaging one of your matches! Tinder and associated apps (such as Hinge and other less popular websites) do not take the time to address serious threats to their platform (I’ve seen countless blank profiles and even couples with both partners not aware or consenting. My reports were instead met with the banning of my own account) and will instead remove its most dedicated users without warning or explanation. If you still choose to download this app, make the best of it while you can, because any unknown action could have you permanently removed!                                                                           |\n",

This affects the stack/deck by showing me people I am not interested in instead of potential matches. I get 30 likes a day and it’s clear they are mostly from men because…why else would they show up if I have it set to women. I paid for tinder to test it out and in under two weeks it’s has shown that the company is grubbing for money with their various levels of subscriptions but will not make an effort to improve the app (these have been known issues since it came out). Now you are losing market share and instead of trying to fix your platform you are changing your prices and adding different features. I do not understand the point of this app if it’s just going to show me men who have swiped right but not women - even though it’s set to man seeking woman Switching to a different app after this months subscription ends - to be fair I have matched with a lot of people but there is no reason I should be sifting through guys when it’s set to women. Flattered that gay men like me but not what I’m interested in hence why I selected women Women get a lot of likes therefore it’s less likely I show up in her deck - if only women could swipe right on me, I would have a better chance of matching because they would show up in my deck sooner. Instead I’m stuck swiping - I see a dude and know my deck count has now been reset and it will be 10, 15, 20 swipes before the next person who likes me shows up in my deck which is usually a guy Lots of fake accounts Basically this is used to advertise only fans and instagram accounts and tinder does very little to clear them from their service I accidentally erased a paragraph - so if you’ve made it here you can probably already tell it’s time to consider a different app |\n",

It almost seems like you only get likes when you pay for the most expensive package. I have spent a lot of money with tinder but don’t have the means to pay for the time being. That being said, I have not seen a like in months. (That excludes bots) \n",

       "2  Tinder, has no way of having any actions to dispute a ban. Seeing how anyone could just ban you for no reason, and tinder “reviews” the ban and bans you. Tinder was alright, but looking back I think a lot of accounts were bot or fake accounts.

But also I met my wife on this app so I’m forced to rate 5 stars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "8  There are a ton of bots and catfish on this app. Also some people only post photos with their head cut off. I’m just pointing out the annoyance. There doesn’t seem to be an algorithm that tracks what a person is interested in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "15 don’t believe all of these fake reviews about a success. they never happen. i spent two weeks on tinder after not using it for 2+ years. i got matches. none of them ever met me, the men are ugly, or i would get none at all. it’s like it’s programmed into the app to do that. match uses “prs” to write fake success stories about finding successes years ago on these apps on the app store. thank you for banning me tinder because i found my love on FEELD, on all places. thank you tinder ❤️❤️ he is my shaggy king. tinder, your ripoff kink app is doing better than you. UPDATE: for the love of god, PLEASE stop with the predatory advertising all over NYC train stations/trains. NOBODY WANTS TO USE THIS TRASHY APP. stop banning people, stop siphoning money from depressed men.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

I reached out to customer service and I am now waiting on a response. This is disheartening especially when there was no notification about the matter prior to. I like this app i actually prefer it over others so this was a huge slap in the face.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "22 This is a very poor product. It's 50% bot/Russian accounts. With time, it hasn't been improved. However, prices are increasing. It's unclear to me what Apple would classify as a scam. Tinder is walking that line. Charging for this app is not honest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "27 Please take note of these reviews before downloading!! Tinder and related dating apps have a serious issue with unprompted banning that needs to be addressed. This is yet another app that abuses its right to shut down your account without warning. I had been banned from Hinge shortly before being banned on here, so I made an extra conscious effort to carefully review and follow every guideline. However, I knew that my time with my account would likely not last much longer, since Hinge’s customer support service previously sent me an email informing me that they could ban my Tinder simply because they had banned my Hinge. Once again, I had followed every guideline with Hinge, yet my appeal was met with disrespectful criticism and a clear ignorance of the content of my account and messages. I will not even bother submitting an appeal with Tinder because at this point it is not worth supporting this company. BUMBLE does not work with either of these companies as far as I know, and I have so far had a much more pleasant experience with that app as a whole. If you’re lucky on Tinder, you may not get banned right away and be able to enjoy your account for a good 10 months before they kick you off in the middle of messaging one of your matches! Tinder and associated apps (such as Hinge and other less popular websites) do not take the time to address serious threats to their platform (I’ve seen countless blank profiles and even couples with both partners not aware or consenting.

       "38 App has been out for how long and you still have it programmed to show me to other men when my setting are man seeking women. This affects the stack/deck by showing me people I am not interested in instead of potential matches. I get 30 likes a day and it’s clear they are mostly from men because…why else would they show up if I have it set to women. I paid for tinder to test it out and in under two weeks it’s has shown that the company is grubbing for money with their various levels of subscriptions but will not make an effort to improve the app (these have been known issues since it came out). Now you are losing market share and instead of trying to fix your platform you are changing your prices and adding different features. I do not understand the point of this app if it’s just going to show me men who have swiped right but not women - even though it’s set to man seeking woman Switching to a different app after this months subscription ends - to be fair I have matched with a lot of people but there is no reason I should be sifting through guys when it’s set to women. Flattered that gay men like me but not what I’m interested in hence why I selected women Women get a lot of likes therefore it’s less likely I show up in her deck - if only women could swipe right on me, I would have a better chance of matching because they would show up in my deck sooner. Instead I’m stuck swiping - I see a dude and know my deck count has now been reset and it will be 10, 15, 20 swipes before the next person who likes me shows up in my deck which is usually a guy Lots of fake accounts Basically this is used to advertise only fans and instagram accounts and tinder does very little to clear them from their service I accidentally erased a paragraph - so if you’ve made it here you can probably already tell it’s time to consider a different app\n",

       "45 First, all it takes is three people reporting you for you to be taken off the app permanently, that’s a concern especially if you have an ex who is trying to get you off the app. \\n\\nSecond, there are options to be non-monogamous as well as polyamorous on the app, however if you share an account with your partner, you will be getting banned for life with no other answer than you violated community guidelines and are a threat to user safety. \\n\\nThird, the “no sharing an account isn’t in huge letters, it’s written towards the bottom of the ToS, that no one reads. \\n\\nFourth, customer service is a joke. I messaged them last night regarding my account being banned, and I was very polite stating if I am allowed an account back, I will not share it with my boyfriend and he will make his own, because it was an honest mistake.

       "50 I do enjoy the app. For what I’m looking for, the app is fairly effective. It almost seems like you only get likes when you pay for the most expensive package. I have spent a lot of money with tinder but don’t have the means to pay for the time being. That being said, I have not seen a like in months. (That excludes bots) \\nOverall a good app though. \\nThank you \\n-Jason                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         "
